            "Review: From the moment Malcom and Marie walk through their door, there is a palpable sense of something awry. An intangible wall separates the two of them, conveyed through speech and movement.This is what makes this film special: whilst it relies on a heightened sense of what relationship arguments are based on (and could definitely have been shorter), there are fundamentals beneath that anyone who has ever cared for somebody else will have felt.Their nagging desire to continue any argument in the hope of stumbling to a resolution is so human it pains you to watch it. They make the same mistakes any other person would. Whilst their quarrels continue, you see their antagonism grow, as you begin to consider other influencing factors.The monochrome palette simplifies the set and enhances the lighting, all shot beautifully through clever camera placement and sharp focus. This benefits Zendaya and John David Washington, both actors who use their faces to maximum effect in conversation. I think what I most enjoyed was that it ultimately felt real.Arguments are hard to write; they require impulse, a selfish mind to shout what it feels, and this is what sets Malcolm and Marie out - the fact that I actually believed them. I think some people might have not enjoyed this film because ultimately, they probably saw some similarities with themselves.\n",

            "Review: I think the people who are giving this movie low ratings we're expecting some kind of a high octane crime thriller or a pulse pounding psycho killer flick. Instead, what we have is a slow burn psychological drama, character driven rather than plot driven.The movie is extremely well cast and acted, with an unexpectedly affecting score. In fact, the score is one of the films greatest strengths and is an excellent track in its own right, something that I will be seeking out on Spotify.I gather that a fair number of reviewers didn't like the ending, and I have to wonder if some of them just didn't get it or were, again, expecting some sort of action ending. That's just not the kind of movie this is. Highly recommended if you are a patient viewer, enjoy a lower key kind of suspense, and appreciate theme and character-centered movies.\n",

            "Review: Initially when stumbling upon the news there was going to be a sequel to \"Wrong Turn\", my prompt reaction (and I'm sure that of many other avid horror fans as well) was to skip it. Let's face it, the 2003 original was good but certainly not great (and actually already quite derivative of \"The Texas Chainsaw Massacre\"), the sequel received the feared straight-to-DVD treatment and the cast is primarily a gathering of nobodies. Only after reading a bunch of praising reviews around here on this website, my curiosity got sparked. People whose opinions I respect and always take into account were referring to \"Wrong Turn 2: Dead End\" as a superior product and literally everybody agreed that the level of blood & gore was much more satisfying. Personally, I can't really say it's better than the original, because it's even more clichéd and depthless, but there's certainly no argument regarding the gore-factor! The lack of theatrical release at least offered one giant advantage, namely there were absolutely no restrictions in the special effects & make-up departments. Not even five minutes into the film and the intestines of a young blond girl (a familiar face for American mainstream TV-viewers) already lay spread out on the streets. After the pleasingly gooey opening comes the overlong and dull but sadly inevitable introduction of the déjà-vu plot and the stereotypical characters. Six greedy & media-horny youngsters participate in the brand new (?) reality-TV show called Ultimate Survivor: The Apocalypse. Former military commander & beefcake host Dale Murphy explains how they'll have to spend five days within the isolated & nearly impenetrable woods of West Virginia, with assignments along the way and no food reserves. Of course, no one's aware these woods are the natural habitat of an inbred family of deformed cannibals. These bloodthirsty and relentless freaks welcome the visitors with open arms and use all their primitive weapons and booby traps to get fresh human meat on the food table. \"Wrong Turn 2\" offers nothing new or special, except a wide & amusing variety of supremely mean-spirited killings, ugliness and perversity. Some of the gory highlights include the birth of a 3rd generation inbred baby, two kills with one arrow, body explosions, an axe in the head and a vicious throat slitting. The absolute cutest toy is a still functioning meat grinder in the cannibals' house and all the victims that go through there end up in barrels full of blood, pus and intestines. Yummy! There's zilch suspense (or what else did you expect?), at the beginning you can immediately appoint which characters will die and in what order, the performances are lamentable and you can count the number of competently written dialogs on the fingers of one hand. \"Wrong Turn 2\" is fun undemanding but also forgettable horror entertainment, nothing more & nothing less.\n",

            "Review: Those who marketed this movie made a huge mistake. They gave a high expectation of a Syfy type movie. I watched this movie with exactly that in mind and it left me lost and confused. I really believe it's because of the lasting impression the marketing left on me.It took me just about past the midway point of the movie I started to realize it wasn't about Syfy at all. It's about drug addiction, the mentally disabled, and homelessness. The moment I recognized this, I had a better impression of the movie. Having a career in LE in a city I experienced many with those difficulties. It's easy to criticize the homeless or dismiss them, but if you had a better understanding of the issues they're having mentally your feelings would change. And I think this movie did a good job putting the viewer inside the mind of an addict/mentally ill person. I only wish those in charge of the marketing would have done a better job.With having a better understanding of the movie, the actors did a great job.\n",

            "Review: A group of young adults is invited to the cast of a \"Survivor\"-style show, filmed in the same woods from \"Wrong Turn\" in West Virginia. Apparently, the producers didn't bother to check the location out very well in advance because those crazy inbred rednecks are still living here and hungry for young, lean human flesh.Director Joe Lynch and the writers of Carrot Top's masterpiece \"Chairman of the Board\" bring us a surprisingly good film. While most straight-to-video sequels are lacking in many ways, this one shines forth with originality and vision. Lynch's previous work was in the world of music videos, and he transitions very well to the horror style. The fact this film has a reality TV element to it may help, but those are not the film's strongest parts.We're treated to a woman who is literally chopped in half (vertically) by an ax, a scene of an inbred mutant masturbating... and plenty of cannibalism. While the worst thing I can say is that the Morlocks were not the most believable as real human beings, if we can look pas that (it's horror, you know) then the movie really kicks you in the nuts (or ovaries).The lovely Erica Leerhsen takes the lead as Nina, Henry Rollins is awesome as the survivalist Dale (a much more natural role than he had in \"Feast\" and a significantly bigger part, as well). I was happy to see Daniella Alonso playing the militant lesbian Amber. Alonso had recently appeared in two very awful films (\"Hood of Horrors\" and \"Hills Have Eyes 2\" -- see separate reviews) and it was good to see her in something where she's given a chance to really act.Speaking of \"Hills 2\", this film is often compared to it. They're both Fox films released in 2007 as sequels to films about mutants who attack people in the wilderness. Well, let me set the record straight here: \"Wrong Turn 2\" deserved a theatrical release and \"Hills 2\" deserved to be straight-to-video (or never made at all). This was a big mistake on the part of Fox. In every category \"Wrong Turn 2\" is superior -- acting, plot, gore, nudity, humor and action.I am unsure how I felt about Crystal Lowe, playing the woman with loose morals named Elena. Sure, she was hot and it's always good to get excessive nudity and sex in a horror film (gratuitous sex and violence sells). But Lowe needs to start moving into more solid acting. She's becoming a name and it's more from her body than anything else. Maybe that's all she wants -- fame is fame -- but I suspect if she wants a long-term movie career, it would be best to move into non-sexy roles soon. Don't get me wrong, though -- I'll keep watching her either way.Kimberly Caldwell (\"American Idol\") played herself and was amazing. Probably the best acting from a musician since Meat Loaf in \"Rocky Horror Picture Show\". Ken Kirzinger (the new Jason Voorhees) shows up, too, but unfortunately he plays yet another character where he is unrecognizable.If you liked the first film, check this one out. Joe Lynch is poised to jump from novice to veteran in the world of horror if he wants it -- this is precisely the sort of film that gets noticed by the fans. I loved it, and I think you will, too. Don't rent that lame \"Hills 2\" when you can get the real deal with \"Wrong Turn 2\".\n",

            "Review: While having never read the book, the premise of the movie was intriguing. To me, it seemed like the perfect wish fulfillment, a movie about girls fighting back and making waves. Ultimately, I was left feeling a tad empty and like many of the \"intersectional\" moments in the film were unearned.Without spoiling the film, I want to say that intersectionality is more than simply including women with various identities. A transgender character is given one line about dead naming, but then isn't given any sort of character arc. Two characters are revealed to be LGBTQ+ in a single kissing scene, but we don't see them really speak to each other the rest of the movie? My cynical side believes this was done so the movie could be shown in more countries by editing out these moments. Much space is given to the main character and her journey with feminism, boys, and her family, which I think was a mistake. There were really fascinating characters that could have built a fantastic, intersectional ensemble cast. Give this cast a plot that investigates the nuanced, experienced journeys of feminine people! Instead we're given throw away lines about gender, disability, ethnicity, race that feel like a screenwriter checking off boxes. Only the character with a mobility disability is ever actually funny with her quips at able-bodied extras.Despite my qualms with the story we were given, this is a well directed movie with great performances. Only in a few scenes did the absurdity of the plot get in the way of believability (the principal knowing dismisses a few things that at most high schools would have resulted in at least an investigation). I won't watch again but I'm glad this movie exists for today's high schoolers as it portrays a positive representation of a high school cishet relationship, friendship among girls, and (of course) feminism.\n",

I'm a teen myself and I have never heard someone say: 'That's rad!' But I have to admit, it was really nice to see these girls stand up for themselves. The 'villain' of the movie is a bit too much in my opinion, but there are people in this world like him. There are human being who behave like that, and it's really uplifting to see the girls unit. I actually stood up at the end speech because I felt what these girls have been trough.

Then we delve into the new tone if the movie, which i also liked. Same with the chris rock comedy. The setup was good, and the story was intriguing.But it did not culminate into anything of note and ranged from mediocre to disappointing for the second half of the movie. The traps were okay, and i feel like there were only four of them. And to make it worse, for two of them they let you know the player didn't survive before showing you the trap, which defeats the purpose and removes the tension.All in all, i liked the idea and the new tone, and i didn't have a bad time with the movie. I will probably give it another chance. And i would be curious to see a continuation of the story. But imo, this is worse than any of the original 7, and on par with jigsaw (part 8). And this is almost exactly what i said about jigsaw (1 viewing, 5/14/2021)SPOILERSthe most disappointing part about this movie is that i guessed the reveal. Guess isn't the right word. I knew who the killer was at about the halfway point and never waivered after that. This has never happened to me with any of the previous 8 movies, even sometimes on second viewing. Maybe it's more difficult to surprise a seasoned fan of the series. But that argument can't be used when the first 8 repeatedly surprised me. And it wasn't even clever.\n",

            "Review: North Hollywood (2020) is the directorial debut of Mikey Alfred, the creative director and founder of the first teen movie studio and skateboard/clothing brand, Illegal Civilization is a film that I have been anticipating for a while now especially since this was produced by Pharrell Williams. NH is a biopic, centered around Mikey, a high school water polo player/alter boy set on his course of being a pro skateboarder. This isn't without its obstacles as his dad and others, mostly Mikey himself, get in his way of achieving his dream. I had the pleasure of attending one of the live stream dates and it felt like such a unique occasion as everything has transitioned to some sort of virtual platform. Least to say that this was a very cool experience for me and I'm sure the rest of the viewers. This movie is not the best movie out. I was definitely expecting more from the Illegal Civ group, but what I saw was an elongated Illegal Civ YT video. I love music don't get me wrong, and music heavily influences the films that I script-write, but a lot of it seemed unnecessary. Some transitions seemed like they were in there because they \"looked and sounded cool\" which they did, but totally threw off the whole tempo of the film. The acting was subpar, especially from Ryder. I love you bro, but you definitely have a long way to go. I will say that some of the performances where very surprising to me, Angus, Nico, Armais, all really well done by them. The scene with Gillian Jacobs was great. I just have problems with the main cast. Miranda Cosgrove didn't really add much for me as Mikey's love interest. Not very compelling when she was on screen. Vince Vaughn as Mikey's dad had his moments, however there were parts where it was hard to distinguish his \"caring\" moments from his \"lecture\" moments. I think this was a great casting job however, but I think this leads into one of my main gripes with the movie, being the script. There were parts in this movie where it felt very natural, however there would be little instances of what I call \"novel dialogue\", sounding like someone is reading from a novel, which really throws thing off during the watch. There were some technical issues when it came to rack focusing, but overall the cinematography was very classic Illegal Civ, which is a good thing as it is unique to them. It is a beautifully shot movie, the set designs, the fits where all very well done. Overall, I see the potential, I really do, but this film left more to be desired. The editing choices, the acting, the script really slid this film of the rails for me. I will be looking out for more films by Illegal Civ however because you guys are sick and I love what you are doing! Keep at it!\n",

The comedy is forced and it just falls flat more times than not. The banter between the leads doesn't work as well as they obviously think it does. It's still a fun watch though, seeing McCarthy do her thing might be getting old but it's still good fun most times.\n",

            "Review: This movie has a most excellent device that if it were to be invented would most likely cause the demise of the human race. Yes, the female sex robot. You just know guys would happily forgo real women for the super sex starved droid that can not have children, does not have that time of month, and is always in the mood. Granted it can only make you a burger and fries for dinner, but that is more than most women know how to do these days anyway. They could probably make a male version for females, but their heads would probably explode because no matter how hard you try to program it to act perfectly, it will still somehow set a woman off by making her mad, or by making her cry the robot would then just short circuit because no matter what it tries it fails. Yes, this is going to get me into a lot of trouble if my girlfriend ever reads this, but my sense of humor is very strange and I am getting a good chuckle. Well on to the rest of the movie. Man and his robot chick start having sex and water gets into the droid and it short circuits. Kind of a flaw right there as you would think they could make these things waterproof. Well he finds out it is impossible to fix and the dealer tries to sell him a newer model, but our hero will not have none of that as he is sort of in love with his bot and so off he goes to a bizarre forbidden zone to find another Cherry 2000 (the name of the particular model of bot he covets). He gets some help from a very attractive Melanie Griffon character and there is a cool scene with a car and a tunnel of water and then our hero gets captured by this weird group in the desert/forbidden zone place. He gets help from a lady he knows, but the main guy in this place is a tad insane, though actually somewhat friendly too. The movie is kind of all over the place because at times it is seemingly trying to be a comedy and at other times a Mad Max type adventure. So not perfect at all and not great, but it passes the time.\n",

You can tell Wan still was involved with certain camera works and scare concepts much like he was with the mediocre yet entraining curse of LaLlarona which this director Michael Chaves debuted on. While he doesn't fill Wan's shoes at all, he was able to follow a certain format for this particular franchise to move forward though at dragging pace at times.The actors are all very good as usual and the duo of Vera Farmiga and Patrick Wilson as the Warren's are phenomenal bursting with emotion as always. They carry this film completely. The effects are decently executed and the cgi looks near flawless. Some of the scares are a mixed bag of ambition and some are tremendously cliche, but they all do their jobs for the horror aspect. The ominous settings are fantastic and add rich environment for the frights to flourish.Overall it's an effort that felt satisfying to see the premier franchise continue, but there's a definitive void without Wan's genius eye.\n",

            "Review: Well, I will say that \"Willy's Wonderland\" was exactly as I had expected it to be, for better or worse.I mean, a movie that is loosely based on the laughable Five Nights At Freddy's games is not exactly bound to prove to be stellar entertainment. And then you throw in a non-speaking, energy drink guzzling Nicolas Cage, and it is the recipe for a success movie, right? Well, hardly so.Sure, I mean, if you are like 10 years old and enjoy the Five Nights At Freddy's games then you will get some enjoyment out of this 2021 movie titled \"Willy's Wonderland\". But if you sit down to watch the movie with the purpose of watching a wholeheartedly entertaining and enjoyable movie, then you will be sorely disappointed.But it should be said that \"Willy's Wonderland\" was watchable enough for the pointless and mindless movie it turned out to be. It can be watched a single time, and never visited again, because the movie just doesn't have contents for a second viewing, no matter how you turn and try to look at it.It was the mindless violence and the caricatured animatronics that made the movie bearable to watch. But if you are looking for a well-written and properly thought-through storyline, then \"Willy's Wonderland\" is not the movie you should be sitting down to watch.The characters in the movie were just ludicrous. Especially the young adults, wow. Talk about a bunch of brainless lemmings milling about. And the Janitor character that Nicolas Cage portrayed was just so ridiculous that it was actually funny to witness.My rating for this from writer G.O. Parsons and director Kevin Lewis lands on a generous four out of ten stars. Chance are, actually, that \"Willy's Wonderland\" might actually turn out to become that particular guilty pleasure movie for some viewers, I think.\n",

            "Review: Well, as I sat down to watch the 2021 horror mystery \"The Seventh Day\" I must admit that two thoughts went through my head. The first thought was with a cast that included both Guy Pearce and Stephen Lang then of course I would be in for a good movie. And my second thought were this will probably be yet another dubious exorcism movie.Yet, I still opted to sit down to watch \"The Seventh Day\" from writer and director Justin P. Lange. And yes, \"The Seventh Day\" was certainly watchable, but that was about it. It was not an overly great movie, despite of having a nice enough twist to the storyline.Nay, the movie just suffered from being a bit too monotonous. There wasn't enough pacing to the storyline and what did happen throughout the course of the movie just felt somewhat generic and not overly interesting. And that, ultimately, made \"The Seventh Day\" into a less than mediocre movie experience. Sure, there were aspects of the storyline that proved to have potential, but writer and director Justin P. Lange just didn't fully cash in on these and take full advantage of the material readily at hand.\"The Seventh Day\" felt monotonous and sort of lulled me into a dull sense of stupor, as there wasn't a whole lot of things going on throughout the course of the movie. Yet, I managed to endure this to the very end. But, alas, I wasn't overly impressed or overly entertained by what transpired.The acting performances in the movie were okay. Sure, I had expected more from Guy Pearce, but Stephen Lang was hardly in the movie at all, which actually was a shame.All in all, then \"The Seventh Day\" is not a movie that enrichen the horror genre, nor is it a particularly outstanding foray into the demonic possession and exorcism subgenres. The things that transpire in this movie is basically something that has been seen and done in other movies, more often than not, also done better in other movies. So this is not a revolutionary movie in any way.My rating of \"The Seventh Day\" lands on a four out of ten stars, as it was somewhat of a disappointing movie.\n",

It's based on a book by James Herbert called 'Shrine'. Jeffrey is a down on his luck reporter. He was caught fabricating facts in his stories and summarily dismissed. He works freelance now and goes for the weird stories such as cattle mutilations. While investigating just such a story, he comes across Cricket. Cricket is a hearing impaired 18 year old girl that uses sign language to communicate-she doesn't talk at all-and lives with her uncle William. William just happens to be the priest at the local church. One day, Cricket starts talking and starts performing miracles. She makes a crippled boy walk, heals a man of emphysema, etc. She says that the Virgin Mary talks to her. Jeffrey has his doubts and thinks that it might be a different Mary talking to Cricket-one that might not be a virgin, perhaps? That's when the Bishop Cary comes to town to verify Cricket's deeds. There are several jump/scares; you know, like loud noises, sudden apparitions coming right at the camera, etc. At the end, there is a biblical passage shown on the screen from Matthew 7:15. If it's been a while since you went to Sunday school, it goes something like this; 'Beware of false profits, which come to you in sheep's clothing, but inwardly they are ravenous wolves'.It's rated \"PG-13\" for violence, terror and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 39 minutes.It's not one that I would buy on DVD but it would be alright as a rental.\n",

            "Review: After watching the 'The Conjuring: Devil made me do it' at an early screening last night, I have to admit I was a little disappointed that it didn't live up to the expectations of the previous two films in the main trilogy ( however it stands tall over the spin offs, so don't worry there).To start off with what I did like, the direction in this instalment is a nice change of pace. With the Warrens looking to save a man on death row after supposedly killing an individual while possessed by a demon. Without going into spoilers the plot shakes things up a bit from the previous two films with the likes of Satanic cults and more or a detective style approach.I personally would of loved to see more of a focus on the court side of the case and the reaction of the defendants plea, it would of been a really refreshing direction for this film but what we get still isn't bad.The Warrens are still great in this film with both Patrick Wilson and Vera Farmiga having a real chemistry on screen and still being one of the most lovable protagonists in horror media in a long time.However with all this said, I believe this 'horror' film does fail in one department, and that is in its scares.It's a shame to say as I believe the previous two instalments had some unique moments of terror.Whereas in this film most moments are so easily telegraphed to an obvious jumpscare that you can see a mile away, or more unique set pieces unfortunately spoilt by the trailers.With all that said, this is still a decent sequel, just not the terrifying sequel I had hoped for!\n",

            "Review: *WARNING: MINOR SPOILERS*When I heard John David Washington and Zendaya were gonna be together in this film, I got excited. Despite their brilliant performances, I have mixed feelings towards this film.Malcolm & Marie takes place during one night where Malcolm and Marie's relationship is tested after Malcolm's movie premiere as they wait for critics' reviews.First of all, I have to admit it's impressive how they were able to make this film during the COVID-19 pandemic. Despite the restrictions they had to place to keep the set safe and its low budget, Malcolm & Marie is a gorgeous looking film that features fantastic performances from both actors. I've been rooting for John David Washington ever since I first saw him in BlacKkKlansman and here he delivers one of his best performances yet. At times I did feel he went over the top but for the most part, he put a lot of passion and emotion into his character. Zendaya is easily the biggest surprise for me in this film. I haven't seen her act extremely well before until now. Her character is much more subtle than Washington's but she deserves every ounce of praise she gets for her portrayal as Marie. Zendaya is certainly the highlight of the film.Whilst the performances may be strong, I have issues with the story itself. The film is essentially a 1 hour 45 minute argument and after a certain point it becomes repetitive. After a point, I understood the structure and that's where I didn't engage with the film as well as I did at the start. They fight, then they make up for a short time, then they fight, and then make up again. The formulà became repetitive and dragged the film as a result. The film is very gorgeous to look at and I feel the black and white suited the film well. The camerawork is also stellar. There is a fantastic one take sequence towards the beginning which gave the actors a lot of room to work with. Sam Levinson's script has a lot to say. It's evident that there is a lot of anger built up inside Levinson that he wants to get off his chest especially during a scene where Washington goes on a long rant bashing a critic. Levinson's film talks about relationships, critics and filmmaking through its runtime which does promote for interesting discussions. At the same time, there are moments where the dialogues feel like they're being read off a page instead of sounding natural and that's not due to the performances but more on the script being overwritten. Like Ma Rainey's Black Bottom and One Night in Miami, this film does also feel more like a play than a film.Malcolm & Marie is one of those films that will split audiences. There are aspects to appreciate but had Levinson put more time in perfecting the script, Malcolm & Marie could have been better.\n",

            "Review: The costumes and overall historical production design looks good, and Andra Day is great playing Billie Holiday, but otherwise \"The United States vs. Billie Holiday\" is a meandering, poorly-constructed biopic. That despite the reflexive framing of the story as a recorded interview that should've focused the narrative besides reflecting the audial sensation of Holiday's singing.Instead, we get a plot that often doesn't seem to be going anywhere besides from scene to scene of shooting up heroin, from concert to concert and abuse or sex scenes from man to man, with a hint of bisexuality. A wallowing, hot-mess portrait of Lady Day. All the while, cut occasionally to narcs planting evidence or saying something racist and inevitably being told off to presumed audience cheering. Even if the remembered scenes of Holiday's past as the black FBI agent follows her from a lynching through her upbringing in a brothel is almost effective, the montage covering again the aforementioned sort of scenes we've already seen several times in slight variations, plus some fight between two guys, certainly isn't. And to top it off there's that atonal, fourth-wall-breaking mid-credits scene after the requisite biopic text at the end to give us the Wikipedia headlines of what happened to the characters after the movie.Yet, Day is great, an actual singer who sings the part and in the imitated style of the character she's performing. Her reported weight loss and picking up of smoking and drinking for the part is some impressive dedication, too, even if she wisely didn't go to Nick Nolte levels of method acting in using heroin as he did for \"The Good Thief\" (2002). Day deserved better direction, the social commentary on civil rights deserved more than simplistic tropes, \"Strange Fruit\" better than \"Tigress and Tweed,\" and Holiday a more focused biographical picture.I'll have to check out \"Lady Sings the Blues\" (1972), which stars Diana Ross and also received awards attention, someday for comparison.\n",

The second half of the film focuses on several plotlines that simply did not even exist in the first half of the movie. Something was clearly done here after the first draft of the screenplay. Were sections cut? Were characters added to \"spice it up\"? We may never know, but the final product feels awkward though it's no fault of the cast here.\n",

Here it's a bit like the Railway Children - exciting incidents at intervals. Realising that archeology might seem dull, it was decided there should be a couple of dramatic accidents and a love affair, neatly spaced through the running time. If only they could really have devoted themselves to transmitting the fascination of the archeology involved. It would have been a big challenge, but great if it had come off. (By the way, it's weird that we are not properly shown the treasure - not even in the end credits.) Instead we have a hefty dose of the dreamy \"last summer before war\" trope, admittedly with the odd downpour. I'm getting round to saying it's a bit boring. The actors: Carey Mulligan is too young, but otherwise wonderful (as is the boy playing her son). Ralph Fiennes is excellent. Lily James is wearing oversized modern designer glasses, lest we forget that she's a beautiful young actress of the 21st century. Johnny Flynn is too old, but gets away with it and really inhabits the period, especially in his manner of speech.\n",

            "Review: It's been a while since audiences have been treated to a classic, procedural crime thriller, and 'The Little Things' has filled that void for those of us who have access to HBO Max.If it feels like we've seen this film before, it's because we have, thanks to a very basic plot and linear story flow. The \"washed up old cop teams up with aggressive young detective\" plotline has been done to death, but it still makes for an interesting watch if the caliber of the actors is high. Fortunately, Denzel Washington and Rami Malek fit that bill well as academy award winning-actors, and while the source material isn't stellar, they both do a respectable job here. Speaking of academy award winners, Jared Leto once again dials up the creep factor as an appliance maintenance guy, so there's that.'Little' is dark, heavy and unsettling at times, and while not an uplifting film by any means, it also has some important takeaways and explores interesting themes including the role of fatherhood and confronting the past. It also serves its intended purpose as a thriller - there are enough twists and turns to make it into a wild ride around LA circa 1990.It won't be remembered as a career highlight for any of its top-billed cast, but 'The Little Things' is worth the time if this is one of your favorite genres.\n",

            "Review: Whilst the 'shark survival' sub genre has plenty of contributors it's probably fair to say that many, if not most, are really let down by either sub standard vfx or by really non committal performances. The few that stand out, including the Reef, The Shallows, and Open Water, do so because they don't skimp on those two very important components. As far as stories go it's very hard to offer much in the way of differentiation. By its very nature the sub genre puts people, mainly young adults admittedly, at the mercy of the ocean's top predatory fish, which through over reliance on the biggest and most recogniseable, as opposed to the most voracious or scheming, becomes a little predictable and trite at times. Great White for me sits firmly in the middle of all these shark movies. It's a predictable story with a predictable setup and outcome. Like many horror movies do, it invites, through its simplicity, audiences to predict who will die when, based on stereotypical characters and character traits. That said, Great White is entertaining enough, blending good performance with live shark footage and enough 'below water, above water' cinematography to induce suspense. What lets it down rather badly are the few occasions where the VFX sharks fall into the Sharknado realm of shoddy and ineffectual. And that's a pity, as with The Shallows level of CGI this could quite easily have avoided the one major pitfall of films in this sub genre - it's too dangerous to get real up close footage to convince. So if you have to fake it - don't appear to be faking it. KONTIKI is your reference if you need to see VFX sharks done seamlessly. Anyway, this is certainly not a bad film, it's entertaining and passable as an entry alongside the films already mentioned. Those who have slammed it unashamedly really are doing it a disservice and frankly their critiques or opinions are little more than the chum that minor characters in this type of film become.\n",

            "Review: The Dig is a well shot filmed, with some great performances from a talented cast. The main issue with The Dig is its pacing. The film is incredibly boring when there's no advancements on the excavation. I think the premise is great and interesting, but the terrible execution ruined most of the interest.There are plenty of subplots that just don't matter, and happen to really slow the movie down. There's a love subplot that feels unnecessary, and I really couldn't be less interested in such subplot. Every film has to have several subplots to keep the film going, but at least make it more about the main characters, or more closely related to the story.The Dig is an overall decent film, but the screenplay slowed down this already slow paced movie. At times I was constantly looking at the clock to see when this movie would end, but it felt like time itself slowed to the same pace as this movie. Some may really love The Dig, but for me, it's a 6/10. Not a bad movie, but it certainly could've been better.\n",

            "Review: Greetings again from the darkness. Have you ever wondered why they warned concert attendees to stay away from the brown acid at Woodstock? I can only speculate, but I assume the poor souls who consumed the taboo drug experienced hallucinations not dissimilar to watching this latest from writer-director Ben Wheatley. Filmmaker Wheatley previously delivered such interesting and diverse fare as the intriguing horror film KILL LIST (2011), the confusing and bizarre HIGH-RISE (2015), and my personal favorite of his, the quite funny and action-packed FREE FIRE (2016).Martin Lowery (Joel Fry, YESTERDAY, 2019) is sent to track down a doctor whose research may provide desperately needed help in fighting a virus that has wreaked havoc on the human race. Martin himself has been in isolation for four months prior to this mission. He teams up with Alma (Ellora Torchia, MIDSOMMAR, 2019), a Park Ranger who works out of a Lodge that has been closed for a year due to the pandemic. She will act as his guide on the 2 day hike through the dense forest to find the doctor.As you would expect, the hike doesn't go smoothly, and things turn very weird and dangerous when Martin and Alma cross paths with Zach (Reece Shearsmith, HIGH-RISE, 2015). He's the ex-husband of Dr. Wendle, the one Martin and Alma are in search of. However, Zach is off the grid and off his (proverbial) rocker. He converses with the forest, which might possibly be his most normal action.Dr. Olivia Wendle (Hayley Squires, I, DANIEL BLAKE) is finally located, and though she and Martin know each other, she seems quite intent on finishing her research in the forest. Back at the Lodge, Alma had filled Martin in on a local folk tale ... the Spirit of the Woods, named Parnag. Most just call it, \"the thing in the woods.\" Are we to believe nature is evil, or is nature just fighting back against humans?Written by Wheatley last year, the film shows the effects of a pandemic on some people and how trying to solve things through science may fall short. Paranoia, distrust, dread, and isolation from others are all at play here - and quite in line with our current state. A supernatural element hovers, but the psychedelic images keep us disoriented, and seem to exist for the sole purpose of visual effects. The strobes are so strong they could trigger responses from sensitive viewers, and if they don't, the gore likely will. Cinematographer Nick Gillespie and composer Clint Mansell are standouts here, and though Wheatley is to be commended for his quick work, the film didn't really click for me. Perhaps the two best comparisons are THE HAPPENING (2008) and the far superior ANNIHILATION (2018).In theaters April 30, 2021.\n",

Next we see another hit, but it has to look like an accident. The Hitman's next assignment is for someone called White Rivers and he has no idea who that is.In the beginning we hear a narrative coming from the Hitman, who needs to tell himself to be careful, don't rush and well you get the idea. I liked the narrative because I am thinking along with him to make sure he doesn't overlook anything. This is cool. Of course, nothing is overlooked. Okay, we knew that.He ends up at a diner at exactly 5pm, the time he was told to be there. He sees a man at a table by himself, a couple at another table and in comes the Deputy (David Morse).

Chris Perfetti as the Motel Clerk; Anthony Hopkins as the Mentor and who can be better at it than Mr. Hopkins?; Abbie Cornish as the Waitress is still very beautiful and a very good actress.Yes, this is very slow going, but we need it to be that way.

            "Review: Before The Social Network was released back in 2010, I never thought of Justin Timberlake as an actor. Yes, he was solid in the film Alpha Dog, but I believe that being directed by David Fincher really broadened his horizons. Starring in films like Friends with Benefits, Trouble with the Curve, or even In Time, he has proven that there's more to him than meets the eye in terms of acting. Palmer only furthered those thoughts for me. While Timberlake never seems to choose projects that will win him awards, he's always very, very solid in whichever role he does take. Palmer has many similar tropes to movies you've seen before, but here's why the subject matter, along with a great central performance by Timberlake, warrants a viewing.After serving time for over a decade, Eddie Palmer (Justin Timberlake) returns home to live with his grandmother, only to see that a troubled family lives next door. Their young boy Sam eventually forms a bond with Palmer, even though Palmer wants literally nothing to do with him when the film opens. Struggling to fit in for being different than other boys in his school, Palmer slowly becomes the father figure that this boy may just need in his life. This sort of premise has been done time and time again, just in different variations. What set it aside from all the others for me though, was the fact that the screenplay by Cheryl Guerriero was far better than I expected it to be.Yes, when breaking the overall movie down, there are some very rushed aspects of the story in the third act, but the dramatic elements to the film felt very authentic. You could tell this was a story that came from the heart. I believed the majority of the dialogue that nearly every character had, which is why I also feel that this movie sputtered slightly towards the end. As much as I loved the dialogue written for these performers, the meat of the story is whether or not Palmer is the right fit for Sam and certain elements of that are sort of thrown away in the third act. There is a resolution to everything, but it feels rushed in comparison with the rest of the film.Now to dive into the performances, because this is a film that relies heavily on selling the premise at hand. As I said, I've always enjoyed the on-screen presence of Justin Timberlake and I truly believe that there is an argument to be made here that he's never been better. I was engaged in this film because of his committed performance. On top of that, young Ryder Allen played off him incredibly well and their bond made this film so much more likeable. Alisha Wainwright as Maggie was also excellent, and Juno Temple as Sam's mother Shelly has a couple of scene-stealing moments as well.In the end, Palmer is the type of film that's designed to be a tear-jerker and those types of films can feel extremely heavy-handed, but I'm just glad to say this one doesn't. It took me on an emotional journey and I was in tears by the end, but it never felt forced. Sadly, the conclusion is far too rushed and revelations and answers are brushed over multiple times. It's almost as though this movie was too focused on creating dramatic scenes that it forgot how to properly reach a conclusion. Still, I really enjoyed watching it and I believe it's worth your time. Palmer is now streaming on Apple TV+.\n",

            "Review: Navy Seal John Kelly (Michael B. Jordan) goes after assassins who attacked his home and killed his pregnant wife Pam (Lauren London) in her bed. John later learns Russian assassins were involved and he was the target.John learns the name Viktor Rykov (Brett Mitchell) the Russian Assassin who got away from his home and vows to go after him. He joins an elite team to go after Rykov in Moscow. While on this mission John learns that there is a covert plot to keep the United States and Russia constantly at war because war is profitable. And the people at the top of each government are responsible.Notables: Jamie Bell as Ritter, A CIA agent who doesn't tell his Seal team everything they need to know; Guy Pierce as Secretary Clay; Jodie Turner-Smith as Karen Greer, John's Commander; Lucy Russell as CIA Director Dillard.Most of the movie has shootings that go on forever. The acting is okay when it's allowed to show up between the shootings. I have never watched a movie where a woman was a Navy Seal as we see Jodie Turner-Smith plays a Navy Seal.Basically, this is a revenge movie. Michael B. Jordan is adequate in here. Oh, he is also a producer of this movie.Let's hope Tom Clancy's other stuff turns out better. In here we didn't care about any of the characters, and yes, there were too many shootings going on all the time. That little bit about the conspiracy was really the point of the movie. Yes, it is watchable, but could have been better. (5/10)Violence: Yes.Sex: No.Nudity: No.Humor: No.Language: No\n",

The pace is slow and the energy is low in about 80% of the film. Tracy Morgan is not adding anything new and Leslie Jones... was more annoying than funny.

            "Review: I was pretty stoked for this movie after seeing the trailer. Figured it'd be a solid arthouse horror picture a la A24 type deal. This is coming from a guy who mostly prefers the B stuff but i enjoy me a good arthouse indie flick now and again.But gee the two main characters were so flat and boring. Like, they couldn't add banter? Find interesting things to talk about while traveling through the woods. I miss the days in horror, and maybe this still happens from time to time, where characters have these very interesting attributes. An example, in del toros chronos, ron pearlman's character was obsessed with the size of his nose and getting a nose job. It was such an interesting tid bit. In this film there was none of that. The characters just flatly said things that were part of the plot. No banter. No conversations. Just \"this is why i'm here\". \"this is what i'm doing\". \"why are you doing this?\" \"oh that's why\".Then a bunch of weird plot stuff, indecision in what the movie is supposed to be. Wicked cool trippy cinematography type stuff that was completely ruined by the entire plot of the movie. A bad explanation about why everything is the way it is.Also the movie alludes to some kind of quarantine at the beginning. Not the one we're in rn i don't believe. But i think the writer thought that this would give it an air of mystery and apocalyptic dread. I think a movie like Monster, a sorta apocalyptic monster film that sorta followed a few people roaming through the forests did this concept well. In The Earth, however, did not. Just felt meaningless and pointless and was just an excuse for non-dialogue that thes indie filmmakers like so much.The last 20 minutes was kinda coool. But not worth what you put into it. I really wanted to walk out of this one.\n",

So everything should look wooooh waaaaah and then you churn this out?I have seen this film a thousand times before in various guises over generations. It's an old plot with absolutely nothing new....not even the promised wooooh waaaah that a big budget would give.But, it's not for me. Old man river and all that. Maybe it's for the younger generation. The young adults. The twenty somethings. Because, chances are they haven't seen a rip off of any polished turd of a movie from the 90s.This is so predictable and pedestrian, I have to ask you to not bother.Action is stuff you've seen before. You never feel real peril or jeopardy.The worst of all is the ending. The explanation for why any of this happened is so lame....so written on a back of a cigarette packet (another 90s reference).....that you think that the world is run by actual idiots as opposed to me calling my brother an idiot (in a jokey way) when he accidentally switched on the electric toothbrush, with toothpaste, before he put the brush in his mouth....no not that type of idiot...the other one.There are scenes in this that are just pointless. The shirt off Michael B Jordan getting ready to box (a nudge and a wink to his role in Creed) but is just....why?I had no empathy for any of the characters in this.If you want to see an army unit do their thing and make it entertaining and almost authentic, check out \"Mosul\".If you want one man non stop action, check out \"Extraction\".There are so so many better films in this genre than this.Really, unless you have a spare box of half eaten cold pizza and a rain soaked Sunday afternoon to kill, there really is no reason to inflict this much waste of time on yourself.\n",

The story ain't bad, yet very clichÃ©, the acting is decent, the chemistry between Liam and the kid co-star is alright altough not great either, but the movie itself is a slow drag. Liam Neeson captured lightning in a bottle with Taken many years ago. Not to say he was not a great actor before, but peoples started to see him as a legit action movie star after that movie, yet he keep appearing in what are mostly slow dragged \"thrillers/drama\" these days sold like action movies ?Yes Liam is not really young anymore, i am not expecting full on fist fight goodness like a Scott Adkins flick, but they could certainly have him shoot more guns, have more stunts and car pursuits, exiting stuff that could be done easily with stunt doubles or respecting his age.This movie is VERY slow pace, there is a few action scenes but they are far in between, and altough the premise is mostly the 2 lead on the run of the cartel, there is never much tension.Yet despite all of this, it manage to just entertain you enough to not bore you. Mostly because Liam Neeson has a great presence, he is a recognizable name and like i said the chemistry with the kid is believable. But its obvious this is another \"chainmade\" scripts like the movie industry pull out a gazillion times each year that they feed to a \"big name\" to sell purchases/rentals and make a decent ammount of $. The surprising part is that this movie actually released in theatre as well. No idea if its because there ain't much movies right now due to Covid, but it has everything to be a low budget direct to VOD movie, the likes you see countless times from Nick Cage or Steven Seagal.Overall nothing much else to say, it filled one of my movie nights while being \"ok\" but i will certainly never watch it again.Oh and Katheryn Winnick fans... well she is barely in the movie at all and don't do much, so don't get your hopes too high.\n",

Everyday people surviving a pack of ordinary sharks, not super-enhanced, not vengeful, nothing like the Deep Blue Sea or Jaws IV, or Meg, whatever.My guess is that they were aiming at a more grounded approach, and it worked ok until a certain point. I think that real sharks probably wouldn't jump out of the water and intercept you mid-air in a bloody fashion, but this kinda takes away the interest from the film. They provide a bare minimum of information about the characters, but this is still a killer shark film and you expect something different from the very basic and tired concept.My biggest problem with it was that up until 50! Minutes into the film, nothing really happens, they just wrap up the set-up. There is also a very awkward racial or ethnic conflict which I did not understand at all, it just felt super forced.It's not spectacular, it's not gory and fun, it's not original in any way, so while I can say that it was a film, I can't think of a reason for anyone to watch it.\n",

It's a fantastic portrayal of Billie Holiday , it's just a shame that the film itself doesn't live up to her billing .This follows Billie Holiday's during her career as she is targeted by the Federal Department of Narcotics with an undercover sting operation led by black Federal Agent Jimmy Fletcher, with whom she had a an affair.I have a few problems with this film . Firstly it feels that Andra Days performance is a little wasted in movie that is so misguided.It feels like a stage play at times and that it's formulaic process where we go from singing , to drug taking to FBI involvement over and over again gets extremely boring .The acting around Andes Day is average at best . Travante Rhodes who plays Jimmy Fletcher is unconvincing and Garrett Hedlund who plays Harry Anslinger is even less so . His mumbling would put Tom Hardy to shame and because of its problems it's feels way too long yet it's only just over two hours .It's good to learn about Billie Holiday and how badly she was treated by the US and to listen to her music but while the actual portrayal does her justice , sadly the film doesn't.\n",

            "Review: Jazz singer Billie Holliday struggles with addiction to heroin and men while being persistently harassed by the FBI for racist reasons.A spectacularly impressive recreation of a historical milieu, with settings, costumes, make-up, ways of speaking and cultural attitudes supremely realistic and immersive. Every scene is a magnificently composed world, but together they form no cohesive narrative, no complex thematic expression apart from a recreation in popular form of a racist history, and no interesting trajectory for a complex, inspirational, talented woman apart from self-destruction and degeneration. There is no depth, no overarching motivation, no transformation, just a pain explained in flashbacks of trauma. Like her controversial song \"Strange Fruit\", the painful and shameful recent history of racist America is being revealed, but is Holliday's strength and talent and legacy being honoured, is her story being given the depth it deserves? Andra Day's performance is the same, extremely impressive on the surface, powerfully lucid within an individual scene, but no dramatic shape. Perhaps the screenplay is to blame. It amounts to a glossy surface and no heart.The film's political theme is clear: lynchings have not yet been banned, even if her song about them was. But the more intimate theme is perhaps akin to Asif Kapadia's powerful documentary Amy: that we, from our distance, though the veil of the media, have some empathy and patience for the particular and real challenges faced by those who pour themselves into music for us.\n",

It was a quasi ripoff of Dean Koontz's Intensity, one of the most thrilling books that I had read till that time. I was hooked on to Aja's work and have followed him closely over the last 15 years.He has churned out some low brow stuff such as Piranha but I have been blown away by The Hills have eyes, Crawl and now Oxygen.There are quite a few twists in this, which I didn't foresee and which changed the whole narrative. Aja's direction and Laurent's acting easily elevate this to the top echelon of locked - room thrillers.Really loved it. Watched it in It's original language (French).\n",

Thank you to all night arguments - we hate you at the time but we reach a better understanding because of you. At least if you haven't had too much to drink, which Zendaya had not because she is getting clean. (JDW had no shame knocking back a few though, right guys?) Thank you to cigarettes and their power to make us look cool. Thank you to strategically placed oven lighters 'cause they help us get the shot without worrying about the vagaries of matchsticks. Thank you to that lady from the LA Times who must be wondering what Sam Levinson has against her. Unless she knows - then she must be thinking \"Wow. Public way to take revenge much?\" but she gonna have hella fun writing her review of this one (I really gotta go look that up.) Thank you to star power and the perception that two people arguing all night will be more interesting if it's two gorgeous stars. (You are correct.) Thank you to the unfortunate choice to weight the movie towards Marie's side of the argument so we're never really in doubt whose side we're meant to be on, leaving JDW with a lot of ground to make up which he can never really do because his arguments are fairly ridiculous. Thank you to the act of shouting which JDW did a lot of, and it was a bold choice but it was the wrong one. Hey, live and learn. Thank you to black and white photography - hoo boy a girl can look good in black and white. Thank you to the bath tub. I would like a free standing bath tub like that. Thank you to film premieres; I have rarely been to one but I know now they are hot beds of intrigue and skullduggery. Thank you to Tana - why DID you say that thing? That was weird. Thank you to nail scissors; you're blunt and we're better for it. Thank you to John Cassavetes; you can't be beat, man. Thank you to covid-19; Sam and 'Daya woulda been making Euphoria right about now if it weren't for you so I guess we have you to thank for this. Thank you to emotional honesty, 'cause when a woman lets a man know that he has taken and taken and taken from her, and he has not not repaid her in kind, he needs to listen or he will find himself alone in the morning and not 'cause his girl is making more mac and cheese. Finally, thank you to articulacy because these boozed-up, late night, beautiful people sure do know how to turn a phrase. Yes Sir. I may be forgetting someone but I'll catch 'em next time.\n",

            "Review: While The Unholy is DEFINITELY not a 10 or a 9... it ALSO isn't a 1 or a 2 (even a 3). First half of the movie feels like a different flick than the second half. First half sets things up and it's creepy and exactly what you'd expect. Second half, feels like a rush to the finish line. Almost like two different directors made this movie.I think people that are genuine and gave the movie a low score... likely had an issue with the script and pacing. However, it's definitely a fairly original take on the classic horror genre (demonic/possession). I'll admit, I'm a bit of a sucker for horror movies based around religion as generally they seem to be more interesting to me.That all said, I think the cast was good. Jeffrey Dean Morgan, William Sadler, Cary Elwes and Cricket Brown were all great. Cricket Brown was especially impressive because I believe this movie is one of her first larger productions and she gives the impression of being a pro in this department. At times, it felt like the cast was not as connected to the movie as they could be. Of course, the movie didn't feel connected to itself after 52 minutes and goes wildly into warp speed conclusions.Directing and Editing were just OK and could have been better IMO.. The script however could use some work. Even though the story felt like one we've seen a million times, I liked the premise and overall theme but the movie veers off and hits walls, then takes off at full speed before veering off into more walls. It provides the conclusions verses letting the audience figure them out. First half of the movie does a good setup job for the characters and direction. Second half of the movie ignores the setup, ignores the characters and goes straight to the source of the problems. It's like they spent a year recording the first half and a month on the second.Overall, not a bad movie. Entertaining for at least half the movie. Good premise. Good acting. Great new acting with Cricket Brown. But, hits a wall halfway through and never recovers. Solid 6 IMO due to acting and overall theme.\n",

Who again have managed to start a car collection that anyone would be proud to own. They could have a field day on ebay. I mean in one of those cars a laptop must exist. Therefore they could have had more money bought a few things had them delivered, maybe ordered a Christmas hamper and ate the delivery dude. Now let me think. Hum! they could not have been too far into the backwoods as there where plenty of cars and these idiots on the survivor show where there. So why no man-hunts for all these missing people? And why is it assumed that these monsters would act this way? And although it would be difficult due to deformities for some of these people to speak (apart from a clear Amen) You would think the parents of the original kids would teach them simple language skills. But I digress (And yes expect far too much from my film-makers)Again predictable deaths (up to a point) and much too quick, for these tormenting cannibals, who actually enjoy playing with their food. Biggest loss Henry Rollins He should have survived and got away. What idiot scriptwriter/director though killing him was a good idea. He was so funny in parts and I laughed out loud at his quips and Rambo-esquire fight preparations. Bad bad film-makers for killing him off. And when the survivors go to the local cops (if they do) then they should all be fired for doing such a bad job of policing this area. And the green stuff in the water bad CGI didn't look real for one second. I would have liked to see the survivors standing over the crib looking at the baby and wondering what to do with it.

It seems like they were just on the verge of really diving into the discovery itself and (critically) why it was so gosh darned important, and then suddenly the story was hijacked by terrorists or something. How else to explain the sudden shift?Instead of paying off all that buildup in digging (literally the name of the film) and character development from the first half, we're suddenly saddled with a whole new cast of characters who are almost completely irrelevant to the story but whose personal relationships suddenly take over the entire second half of the film, pushing the original characters onto the sidelines and derailing the entire effort. Not only are the original characters sidelined, but the discovery itself practically becomes an afterthought.Instead we're left following a bunch of random jerkweasels down idiotic subplots about adultery (actual) and homosexuality (implied), none of which have even the slightest relevance to the original story or characters. Was this another case of producers putting their grubby little fingers into things and wrecking it all up? I can only speculate.In the end the film earns a \"Eh, it passed the time...\" 5 Star rating, and that only barely and on account of stellar performances and a good first half that was clearly spoiled by nefarious persons.

Don't get me wrong, after all I've read and seen over the decades, I STILL can't say that I know the full Fred Hampton story. But I know THIS film isn't anywhere NEAR a true depiction. This movie here is just trying to get some empathy awards during/before Oscar time based on race and the BLM movement. All that \"Judas and the Black Messiah\" really is is a slow emotional buildup to a black mans assassination. The SAD part is that this film could have easily been about ANY black man, because it never once depicted the true Fred Hampton. The title \" Judas and the Black Messiah\" doesn't even focus on who Bill O'Neal (Judas) was and what his motivations REALLY were. All we know from the \"filmmaker\" is that she views O'Neal as a traitor. Why not tell us why? Because emotion kills logic, so there doesn't have to be any truth OR logic right? If there are any people who are interested in more truth about Hampton or BBP? Try any and every documentary on the subject before you use this film as the truth.This movie is just more lazy filmmaking.\n",

It's modernism isn't subtle in the slightest using modern liberal white girl slang and some typical dialogue you hear thrown around in modern day \"progressive\" films that waters it down as almost like a corporate \"we understand you\" type of way. For a high school film it's not too bad, but extremely unrealistic how high schools run and act that make for some major eye-roll moments. The story is powerful enough to get some movement behind it, but it just feels like a typical high school rebellious film with a lot of feminist activism thrown into it that felt heavily forced.

Taking place in a rented home during the night, we have our leads Washington, a filmmaker & Zendaya, his on the mend from drugs muse celebrating the reception his latest film has gotten. What starts out as a seemingly joyous celebration soon devolves into a night of accusations, recriminations & regret as Zendaya feels at first she wasn't thanked properly during his speech but then as the verbal scab pulling intensifies she reveals she wanted the coveted role (she is an aspiring actress) which puts Washington on the hot seat. Filmed in gorgeous black & white, writer/director Sam Levinson (Zendaya is front & center on his HBO adaptation series Euphoria) wisely lets the actors eat up the volleys as the words start to fly & sometimes catch metaphorical blood.

In a film, you are supposed to sympathize with characters and go through their journey and change, but here I found myself hating both characters.

Mostly because of the amount of precious artefacts recovered. There was no surprise that the Anglo-Saxons populated the area, so it's not really comparable to any, say, south-american excavation revolutionizing our understanding of precolombian civilization.Anyway, the story is of Basil Brown, a \"guy\" who is called in to excavate a whole bunch of burial mounds. These mounds, being literal mounds of dirt, do not do much in the real of opposing to being dug up, and as such the digging goes on as expected. There is one pathetic scene of a cave-in (in a situation where it couldn't actually happen, but that is how desperate this film is for attention), but otherwise there is little conflict in this film that's beyond some harsh words at the team table.And, you know, conflict happens to be one of the major pivotal points of filmmaking. You really *do* need an antagonist in your film, if you're gonna have something that the protagonist is struggling against. And a protagonist's struggle is what causes the viewer to identify with the protagonist. I am sure that any filmmaker put in charge of several million quid's worth of budget knows.So, Basil Brown digs the defenseless mounds of earth, finds a wooden ship, a guy from the British Museum shows up, and the end...\n",

While there are some vaguely interesting attempts at period recreation, there is very little else of interest, and, i dare question why the subject matter was even considered exciting enough for a full-length film in the first place.

            "Review: Directing: Elisabeth Röhm did a great job with this small budget movie and delivered the message she intended to send, although there were many flaws and mistakes, but the message did go through as intended.Production: Again, this is a low budget movie and have as a result some limitations that were obvious. I genuinely believe that with some extra effort this would have been an amazing theatrical piece but sadly it's not. Nevertheless, they did a great job.Script: Although the movie is classified as Crime and Thriller, the story is based on the real-life events of Elisabeth Fritzl and the abuse she suffered at the hands of her father, Josef. Even though the story is well documented, it took 3 writers to write it and did so horribly. The script is a major setback imo.Acting: Stefanie Scott did great and so did Judd Nelson whom I did not even recognize at first. Almost all did a good job but what disappointed me the most was that the horribly written script that clearly showed in their performance.Cinema and sound: To be honest, while watching, neither the music nor the camera work bothered me. They did a better job than I expected.Conclusion: These kinds of stories need to have a weigh and a certain play on emotions as well as balance of power. On one hand would be the abusive power the dad holds against the daughter and her own power to withstand and live through it. Sadly, the latter was not as evident.I give Girl in the Basement a rating of 5/10.\n",

So I wondered what the director could come up with, considering all limitations that this period bringed.The movie is set during one single night. For the entire length we see a couple going back and forth to the most painful and excruciating fight of their relationship. A lot of deep feelings are involved and the cast managed to portray extremely good the emotional weight of a story that is going to be tested really hard, and that maybe is on the brink. Cast nailed it and I liked both actors. Washington is on fire, he always kept such an intense energy for all scenes, he was dedicated to the role and you can clearly see this. Zendaya was a surprise for me, never heard of her, and even if she is not at the same level of her colleague, she still delivers a convincing acting.The first half of the movie is well conceived and kept me glued on the screen of my TV, but then on the second part it is just too repetitive. The couple fight always on same topics, two monologues portrayed by Malcolm are basically the same, nothing is added. Was it really necessary to make a movie almost two hours long? I think that this could have worked better just with a shorter runtime. The film could have been way more effective if it lasted just a little bit over one hour. It is more than enough to introduce, develop and end the story, At some point I was really wondering when it was going to end.Even though the entire film is set in a house, it feels very dynamic and intense. I suggest to watch it just out of curiosity, but do not expect a masterpiece. I personally liked the fact that was shot in black and white, I think that it just work better in this way, instead of using color.\n",

However, she delivered but the movie is just outright pointless and exhausting. Two people yelling for around 100 minutes, playing music, smoking and cooking that's all you get. You wait for something to happen but it never does they fight, take a break then fight again.John David Washington is becoming bit of a disappointment, he was great in BlackKKlansman but since then his boring uncharismatic turn in Tenet and now here with Over the Top performance makes you wonder about his choices as an actor. A good actor should be good in anything regardless of the director but he just can't hold on to his own.Sam's Assassination of the Nation was over the top but fun timepass which lead to Euphoria but here he went 2 steps back instead of forward. A pointless dialogue bonanza winning no accolades or appreciation. Good they get to make a movie in a pandemic but it's we who have to suffer. Things we do for ZENDAYA!!!\n",

Who are going on a voyage to a new planet to colonize and start over. But while on a space voyage. They discover there pleasure senses have been reduced from a drug they been taking. They decide to stop which there wild instincts kick in into madness. Which the group of teens will be divided from trying to have a civilized rule to a living life wild which can put the future of humanity at risk.What worked? The concept and plot is promising. In a future. Earth is no longer livable. Researchers decides to genetically create humans so they wont be attached from leaving earth. They have been isolated from civilization. And Richard (Colin Farrell) who is a researcher and a mentor. Tags along with the space crew to make sure they are behaving. Until they start to lose control.The set designs and visual effects are great. Kind of feels similiar to the movie Passengers.The cast ensemble is good. Colin Farrell is good. Tye Sheridan and Lily-Rose Depp were great. Fionn Whitehead playing a rebellious teen who is trying to create fear within the group and trying to live there lives selfishly was good too.What did not work? The film is a slow burn thriller. The second act is slow and boring in the middle. Could have been a faster direction. The film does pick up when tension rises with Tye Sheridan and Fionn Whitehead are divided and fighting each other.Also the music score was a bit dull for a science fiction space thriller. Which kind of made the movie feel a little dull.It does have an interesting premise and some thrills and a great cast. Which could have been better.\n",

            "Review: As \"Voyagers\" (2021 release; 108 min.) opens, we are informed that in 2063 a new planet is discovered that will allow the human race to survive, but it will take 86 years to get there. A crew 0f 30 young people is being prepped in isolation for the journey. Then out of the blue Richard, the mission's leader, announces he wants to go along as well, even though it is an one-way ticket and means certain death. The mission takes off in 2067, and then we go to \"Ten Years Later\"... At this point we are 10 minutes into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this s the latest film from writer-director Neil Burger, who is quite familiar with the sci-fi genre from his 2014 film \"Divergent\". Here he brings a new variation on a familiar theme: how the human race looks to the skies for survival on another faraway earth-like planet. In and of itself an intriguing premise (and hence one that is revisited regularly by Hollywood). The new element is that the crew of 30 will never reach the end and hence it will be their children and grandchildren who will benefit from all this. So far so good. Sadly, the movie makes a 90 degree (or frankly even 180 degree) diversion into \"Lord of the Flies In Space\" that is frankly pointless and plain dumb, and from which the movie never recovers. Colin Farrell (as Richard) appears for about the initial 45 min. In the film (in the all too obvious \"we need a star attached top this project\" tole. The rest of the cast are mostly non-names, the best of which is Lily-Rose Depp (yes, Johnny's daughter) who bears a striking resemblance to her mother (Vanessa Paradis). The movie's electronic core (by a certain Trevor Gureckis) is a blatant rip-off from Hana Zimmer's electronic scores like \"Blade Runner 2049\". The movie's production set is stylish and looks quite nice, keeping in mind the movie's relative low production budget (about $30 million). But none of these issues can mask the fact that the movie's strong start fizzles out completely and never recovers.\"Voyagers\" was supposed to open in theaters last Fall but a little thing called COVID-19 had other plans. It finally opened this weekend. The Friday early evening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati turned out to be a private screening: I was the only person in the theater. The rest of the 16 screen movieplex was an absolute ghost town, just eerie. Meanwhile, whether you are a fan of sci-fi movies or simply a fan of Colin Farrell and you keep your expectations low, I'd suggest you check this out, be it in the theaters, on VOD< or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.\n",

            "I believe Albert wasn't the killer. I know that's a common consensus. I don't think Deke or Jimmy was either. However, the confusion and frustration of not getting an answer from the film is actually the result expected. We, as an audience, are to feel just as lost and frustrated with the unknown and unresolved as Deke and Jimmy do. To feel just like how it is to be a obsessive Detective to the point where your perception has become so skewed from obsession, you're desperate for an answer. To the point where you break and it has consequences. Perhaps to show us how being a dedicated detective has its weight that finally breaks them down. Deke knows this finally, as Jimmy's situation wakes him up, however, he doesn't want Jimmy to become him. Thus buying the red clip to assure Jimmy that Albert was actually the killer, thus making him feel justified in killing him. While in reality, it wasn't Albert and it's another burden that Deke has to carry on with within his conscious.All in all, I believe the movie is to show the best of the best get a breaking point at some point, not wanting to admit defeat or that they just aren't as good as they used to be. Because all the sacrifices they give to dedicate their time into finding the killer or victims, they want it to be time that was well spent instead of time wasted making their life miserable.\n",

I've lived on 3 islands for over 30 years and I can assure you that this movie is a parody of Hawaiian life. From the hick cars, to a guy that's about to lose his house on O'ahu for not paying 5 years back taxes ... that'd be like losing a million dollar home and land for about $10K in taxes.Then there's the language and speeches of EVERYONE. Nobody talks like this here. Pidgin? Sure! But not like they portray.The way they treat kapuna and heiau's would, or should, insult just about every local here.The portrayal of the living conditions all the way to the POS island cars is ludicrous at best. This would be right for a person living in Puna on the Big Island (but doubtful) but the islands don't allow junk cars much (safety inspections required here) ... lots of rust buckets, but that's about it.The use of a box of spam by a kid to reach the pedals on a car?! Not even.Everybody like, \"ohana\" and always giving away fruits, fish, etc... Hawaii is friendly, the people great, but this?! No. And the way it tries to shame the Hawaiian that's moved to New York is shameful in itself.Much of this is a rip of other shows ... especially \"The Goonies.\"Casper, the white-redhead haole kid, is typical of the stereotyping of this show.The lack of respect of these people, especially the young to the older generation, is plain silly for Hawaiians! I tell you, aunty ever here her keiki give lip or stink eye like dat, she give'em the slippa!Anyway, this show is a four at best and that's because there's not enough Hawaiian motivated movies and it tries to portray the island as something magical (which it is) but in a horrible fashion!

While investigating a Metallica symbol shaved on the butt of a cow he accidentally sets off a series of fantastic events by breaking the doll he found in the field used to bind previously killed girl. Everything goes well until he realizes he must get the genie back in the bottle.Jeffrey Dean Morgan gives us a good performance of his character.

Their future is very fragile and they both have to work very hard to continue together.Since I had already watched the two previous movies I knew what to expect from this one too but I have to admit that it was better than what I was expecting. Despite that for one more time the plot was missing, the movie had some good scenes but it was very predictable. The direction which was made by Michael Fimognari, it was average and since the plot was predictable and we did not watch anything new, made the movie boring. To sum up, I have to say that \"To All the Boys: Always and Forever\" is a classic teenage movie to spend your time with but do not expect much from it.\n",

            "Review: \"The Marksman\" (2021 release; 108 min.) brings the story of retired Marine Jim Hanson. As the film opens, a Mexican drug cartel is hot on the heels of Carlos, who calls his family that they need to flee the house. We fo to \"Naco, Arizona\", where Hanson shoots a wolf from long distance. Upon returning to his ranch, he is served eviction papers by the bank for being 6 months late in his mortgage payments. We go to \"the US/Mexico Border, Monday\", and as Hanson is driving his truck, a young boy and his mom are crossing the border just as the cartel arrives on the scene and demand their return. Hanson refuses... At this point we are 10 min. into the film but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the latest film from Oscar-nominated producer Robert Lorenz (\"American Sniper\", :Letters From Iwo Jima\"), but only his second movie directing. Here he brings the latest action hero vehicle for Liam Neeson. Nesson, bless his heart, give his all but even he cannot save the weak script that he has been dealt. The entire film is so utterly predicable from the get-go, and feels like it's done strictly by the numbers. Liam Neeson takes on the Mexican drug cartel all by himself. Truly a one man army against the might of the Mexican drug cartel. I wonder who will win that battle... Don't you wonder also? This film is from the same production house that just 4 months ago released the previous Neesom action flick \"Honest Thief\". In fact these Neesom films are coming at us so fast and furious, they now seems to blend in from one to the next. And yet, I and many others kep turning up. Why? Because Neesom is really good at this, for one, and it is like comfort food (comfort film?) in difficult times. Reason I still rate 3 stars when all is said and done.\"The Marksman\" opened in theaters in mid-January and I just saw it this past weekend (2ne week of release). The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at was attended okay (about 10 people, which is above average as COVID-19 continues to rage from coast to coast). If you are in the mood for another serving of Liam Neesom as action film hero and ready to save the world, I'd readily suggest you check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD or eventuallay on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.\n",

            "Review: Malcolm and Marie is a pulchritudinous, realistic but suffocating film about an ostentatious, navel-gazing filmmaker (John David Washington) and his recovering addict, relentless girlfriend (Zendaya) that come home after Malcolm's (Washington) first movie premiere. During the film the couple toxically argue over and over, make up, tease the audience with a sex scene and Marie (Zendaya) exhaustingly and frustratingly starts arguing with Malcolm again. It's a cycle that becomes more monotonous every time it begins. Within half an hour it becomes conspicuous that this is going to be the entire narrative. Despite this, cinematically it is beautiful and unique in appearance and has that quality of a \"film having a heart\", to quote Malcolm. An excellent film for filmmakers; but a tedious one for everybody else.\n",

            "Review: I feel like the 3rd movie in a franchise (apart from Harry Potter and Avengers of course) is always so slow and feels like a filler for the unfortunate sequel to come.Lara Jean and Noah plan to spend their college years together and this final year of high school is literally Lara deciding whether or not Berkley is the one for her .... and then you have other insignificant subplots like Chrissy and her on/off boyfriend, Lara's Dad remarrying and Peter and his birth dad reconnecting (sort of).The dialogue and character interaction was kinda dry compared to the last two movies - Noah's character was basically put on auto pilot. I mean, where was his cute and funny charm from the first film? Did someone he love die in between the 2nd and 3rd film? Character relationships didn't seem to be going anywhere and it was like watching paint dry -- no development whatsoever. Peter and Lara's relationship development never got anywhere just like pushing jelly up a hill.The main thing I disliked was making out like losing your virginity at 17/18 is the most important thing a boy and girl should do before they graduate high school. Having sex in order to commemorate a relationship and make the bond stronger is utter bull-faeces. The idea of the couple in this franchise was supposed to be cheesy like the 80s movies they reference a lot -- adding those few shots which insinuated the sex, lost that recurring theme.Moreover, the film was unnecessarily long. I feel like they coulda cut all the silly montages such as the NY trip because really, a city's environment shouldn't be the ONLY reason one moves to a college in said city. Very random for her to just choose NYC just because she met a few \"cool\" hipsters and helped carry a sofa from a party onto the New York subway. Good music but it barely carried the scenes. And finally, I get that kids' use their phones A LOT in 2021 but enough of the weird phone screen views - there's just too much exposition.Overall, the \"should I choose college or Peter\" plot was longed out and coulda easily been done in 20mins.\n",

            "Review: Why would they hire actress Elisabeth Röhm, to direct this film, when she's never been behind a camera before? This was such a troubling and horrific true story event, it needed professionals to tell it. The screenplay was on point, but Röhm's failure to direct her cast and scenes properly, really failed this film. Performances were adequate to decent, but that was strictly from the merits of the actors following a screenplay. Stefanie Scott's performance got better as the movie progressed, but I'm sure that was due to her getting comfortable with her character. Even Judd Nelson's performance was stale and amateurish, that with a better director, he would've shined. Had a seasoned director been involved, this could've been much more gut-wrenching and epic film. Nevertheless, it's a story that needed to be told, and I'm glad it was; It was a bold move for Lifetime to produce this. I just wish it was told in a better way. It's a generous 6/10 from me.\n",

            "Review: IN BRIEF: Fine acting covers up some flaws in the story department in this well directed two character drama.JIM'S REVIEW: (RECOMMENDED) After a successful movie premiere, filmmaker Malcolm Elliott and his girlfriend Marie return home to \"discuss\" the events of the evening, or more so, their imploding relationship. It seems he made the ultimate public faux pas: a glaring omission of not thanking his beloved for her undying support. The verbal fireworks are lit in Sam Levinson's two character drama. Malcolm and Marie. However it appears that director/ writer also forgot to thank Edward Albee too.Now if you are planning to do a two person drama, then you best have a script filled with thought-provoking dialog and a duo of actors who know their craft. Kinda to the former, a definite yes to the latter.\n",
            "After all, words become the action in this scenario. In fact, they matter the most. Malcolm & Marie loses track of that fact as the couple bicker and yell and their topics range from ex-girlfriends, white privilege, mediocrity, and famous film directors with much talk in-between about love and hate. This marathon plays out in real time, so this nearly two hour gabfest exhaust rather than enlightens. After all, when was the last time you made your significant other feel insignificant by calmly saying, \"I can snap you like a twig\". Such sweet talk!Filmed during the COVID quarantine, this film maximizes its social distancing in showing an unhappy couple with deep-rooted commitment issues. It also keeps its distance from its moviegoers, which is not a good thing. Throughout this long morning hour session, our temperamental filmmaker and his ex-addict girlfriend throw themselves into sadomasochistic behaviors that would rival George or Martha, but the payoff feels incomplete.Mr. Levinson sets-up his drama with various rants about art, guilt, and shame in his first act and finally questioning authenticity in his second act, a quantity that his film lacks. Often, the dialog seems contrived and manipulative. The film never builds to a satisfying conclusion and one wonders why these two would ever stay in this combative relationship. He is so narcissistic and egotistical with definite anger issues; she is unable to admit her own flaws and jealousy issues.Now, dear moviegoer, you would think I could not recommend this film from my words thus far...but I do. Although some of you would not enjoy this movie at all, there is much to admire here. Mr. Levinson solidly directs his fight scenes with style, even if he sometimes fumble with his wordplay. This is not to say that his screenplay doesn't have insight and bravado. It does, many times over. But where the film truly excels is in its quieter moments and its use of a soundtrack playlist that helps convey the emotional wreckage this couple endures. The fluid b&w cinematography by Marcell Rév is some of the best you will see this year. And foremost is the talented cast of two who are building quite an impressive resume.John David Washington has the more difficult role as Malcolm. As written, his unpleasant character is angry and angrier. Not a wide range, but he does rage very well. He also brings some charisma and nuance to his underwritten role. This is his personal best and one is greatly encouraged to see more of his future work. Zendaya has the better written part as both victim and attacker. She creates a vivid figure, showing her character's determination and vulnerability. Her final seven minute \"thank you\" speech is mesmerizing and the actress may earn some accolades just for that speech alone. Both actors handle the movie's frequent lengthy monologues most astutely and their chemistry together makes the film more palpable.Like that proverbial glass of water, Malcolm and Marie asks its philosophic questions about life, but yet the debate remain unanswered. Is it half empty, half full...or all wet? (GRADE: B-)NOTE: See the recent drama, Marriage Story (2019), for a definitive film on this subject very done well. It's sheer poetry.\n",

Mount still implemented his aura when he played the fierce character in \"Hell on Wheels\" as totally inappropriate. A hitman or assassin should not show his intensity everytime when he was in a social contact with the common people. He just looked so different and stand out among regular people, he didn't blend in but a rooster among hens; that's an absolute NO NO in the first place. He's so intense and looked so obviously intense with animosity to others, only made him look so unprofessional. Then again, signed up Abbie Cornish to play the diner's waitress was another misstep unforgivable, but even so, she's more looked like a seasoned virtuoso than Mount, who played it. But Cornish really has to watch out her weight, it seems a bit of out of control and readily to explode. Hawkins, well, this movie got to borrow some heavy wt. Actor to fool viewers to think that this movie would be great, but not in the least. He's not a magician or savior to salvage a terrible screenplay with limited budget for a B movie and, I'd guess a large part of the budget was paid to him for his participation.

But if you are looking for something actually different do not watch. In my opinion this movie is nothing special. They are trying way to hard to make the girl character \" quirky\" and \" unique\" she's nice but she's the definition of the kind of girl producers try to make when they try to make that one girl look \" quirky and different\" The storyline is basic and nothing new. I understand the message is super sweet and inspirational, to find the perfect things in my life. But in my opinion they chose the wrong characters for this. My idea of what the concept in that topic should be is to find the unexpected even in the expected. And the fact is you could pull a guy and a girl like him from any basic highschool and force them to see the \" beautiful in life\" and they would all act the same. Plus the romance is basically forced because the guy really wanted to meet someone and he could have met any girl who was cute or \" quirky\" and been like I like you. And that's not unique or different at all. Because without the loop it would have just been like those basic highschool movies where the \" different girl\" meets the nice but hot guy. The only slightly unique thing is the idea of trying to find the perfect things in life but it's delivered in such a basic way with a basic cast.\n",

            "Review: How did Liam Neeson go from Schindler's List to this?Sure, you do some bad movies for a paycheck, but usually he at least acts like he cares in his movies. In this film he just went on autopilot after the opening scene, and the other actors look like they're completely asleep. Out of all the auxiliary characters, the kid's mother, the girl at the gas station and the main villain's driver emote the most. Those are barely even speaking roles.It's hard to even call this a movie, since there is barely any plot to the whole thing. Most of the setups go nowhere. Neeson's relationship to his cop friend ends up being pointless filler, his house is burned down after he already chose to leave, he loses his rifle at one scene only to immediately buy another in a scene later. Hardly anything in the film is of consequence. It's basically Neeson and the kid, who share absolutely no chemistry, on a bland road trip and the bad guys slowly gaining on them, because they track his credit card usage.There is no ticking clock element, no hard choices to make by any of the characters, nothing of consequence. Add to this the fact that the film has barely any score and only two action scenes, one of which consists of guys walking slowly before being shot through a scope - off screen.The film feels like it's trying to make a point about the border, but I can't even make out what it is. Farmers shouldn't report illegals, because the cartels may be after them? But at the same time the official border checkpoints are corrupt and the cartels just pass through? Buying an unregistered gun is good? All of these scenes felt tacked on and again have no bearing on the main plot.Rarely have I seen a script with so little thought put into it. This is a Nicholas Cage / Bruce Willis level bad film. I really hope Liam Neeson's next project will be better than this. This is the latest and by far the worst in a string of stinkers.\n",

He took the Ghidorah skull from the last movie and then suddenly someone else gets it? Why is Dr Mark Russel even in this film? He does literally nothing in three different parts of the planet. Why does Ilene Andrews call after Jia when she runs off? She's DEAF! Why is Maya Simmons in this movie? She's the disposable daughter of the mad genius who displays no talent at all and dies off camera.Let's ignore the sheer human deaths in the thousands in every major act. Yet in every film to date, these awful parents allow their children to interact with titans. Usually when it's raining. Let's forget that children are able to walk inside not one, not two, but three highly sophisticated and guarded locations without interference. Plus they hitch a ride into some kind of mag-lev container which is transporting eggs we never hear about again and has a display in MPH even though it's an Hong Kong craft. The only thing this film does better than Godzilla: King of the monsters is there's fewer scenes with rain. But there's still a ton of rain. Why? I don't know.Why did they need Kong to \"lead\" them into hollow earth. They already had a reinforced cave leading to it. Kong didn't do anything except fall through a wormhole unscathed. While the humans needed three anti-gravity spaceships to travel there. And of course the debunked defamed author Nathan Lind is somehow also a pilot who once safely back home decides to stay airborne to watch the Titans battle it out instead of getting far away like a sane person might do. And this magical author/pilot found the single switch on the control panel which turns it into an ape defibrillator. And sure, chain up a titan on a transport boat but let's rig up a single lever to let him go. Hey, here's an idea, let's upload the essence of a dead hydra skull brain into a robot's energy source.Let's talk about how every light source in the facilities, crafts and bases plus all the buildings are lit in neon trim like they looted the set of TRON:legacy. How come Apex needed this mysterious energy source from Hollow Earth and when they take a small sample, they only thing they needed was math to recreate it? Did you know all you need to interrupt a satellite uplink into an unguarded control room is a half flask of booze poured on the cooling fan? I didn't, but the randomly Australian comic relief did.There's hardly a hint of blood from either monster even though Godzilla rakes its claws deep into Kong's flesh multiple times and both are dragged face-first into glass and steel buildings. Kong is also a master axe-man who uses the blade as a tool, a key and a shield.I could go on and on about this film but I am exhausted. If only someone could fly a tiny spaceship into my chest and restart me.\n",

            "Review: This movie make zero sense other than they wanted Tom Clancy in the title of of the movie. It literally has nothing to do with the books or the characters.One, John Kelly aka Clark's wife and daughter are not only alive, but his daughter is married to his second in command Ding Chavez. In the books, the origin of John Clark, has him in his mid to late 20's with his story ending with him being married to Pam and having a daughter on the way. The Rainbow Group happens a little over 20 years later with his daughter being married to his younger second in command.Currently, John Clark is in his early 70's and is in charge of his new group of operators , \"The Campus\" and Jack Ryan Jr. Is one of his agents.Nothing about the movie makes sense as it relates to the ongoing books.While I appreciate they have to make changes, they would have been better off setting this up in the late 70's or early 80's.Spoiler but not reallyThe movie on it's own, regardless of the books was also ridiculous on it's own. How many people gather around in a street while an active sniper is shooting? How many cops simply walk around in an active shooter sequence when two of their own get shot. I mean, just meandering around.\n",

Every actor was terrible, both writers ran the script through Google Translate, and the director must have had every single decision overridden by the editors. It was a film made by a team of people who never met and couldn't agree on what the film was supposed to be. It felt like a high school play. Just awful.One of the worst things about this film is the assumption that you have goldfish-levels of memory, so nearly every scene contains a flashback to the scene before it. \"Remember when this happened 25 seconds ago?

Kathryn Newton isn't attractive enough to pique our interest or serve as a credible romantic prize, which is where these things always.They're sexless, as well. They could be any gender.The girl's ignorance is on an essential point is unintentional. Why would one assume that what they're dealing with is in any way Euclidean? She claims that time is not the fourth dimension, when according to Einsteinian spacetime, which superceded the Euclidean, time is indeed the fourth dimension, and there's no reason to think this repetition is only occurring on some Euclidean scale.Then she misunderstands the representation of a fourth, spatial dimension, treating it as a very real thing, then as a kind of metaphor, which is not unreasonable, but it ultimately makes no sense.The search for perfect things is okay, but it's gotten a bit dull and we're only 33m in, and he's in the process of trying to \"win\" the girl, as if she was the what mattered. Ugh.\"It's all I got. Take it or leave it.\" Way to be a piece of crap. And like a weakling he mumbles he'll accept it. How can boys grow up sanely when this garbage is all they see, day in day out?At the midpoint of the run time he's at his nadir, having made an incredible series of moves that only resulted in a flat and even insulting rejection.The script blunders with an unpleasant exchange between the lead and Al Madrigal, who brings nothing to the role of a needlessly irritated algebra teacher. Why not get a very talented comedian to play the role and shoot for something like a scene between Bill Murray and Ned Ryerson (Stephen Tobolowsky). With this one, they're not even trying.So he ends up interpreting all this as 'she made me a better man' and that his own life isn't even his story, and we're supposed to believe this is personal progress. Then we get ridiculous 'wisdom' from her mother who's dying of cancer. \"It's never too late, unless you're dying of cancer.\" Spare me your delusional American fantasy of hope.It's the horror of contemporary feminism, writ small, but then in having the girl realizing she has feelings for him, it's trying to eat its cake and have it too.\n",

            "Review: * SIGH * And here it is, the second \"blast from the past\" disappointment in a row... First, we've got Tom & Jerry with Spike crapping all over the place and now? Now we've got this. Like everybody else, I loved the original movie. Together with Trading Places, it was, like, one of the best comedies from eighties. So, even though I tried to keep my expectations here as low as possible to avoid being disappointed much, I still hoped for good. Like Agent Mulder? I wanted to believe. Unfortunately... yeah. You know how it is. Didn't happen. Like... at all.First of all, it's exactly as forced as you may expect. Every single scene and every single line here screams \"forced\". The original Coming to America was daring, it was fresh and, well, it was... you know... FUN. This? It's just a forced mess. One of those movies that you forget right after you're done watching. Heck, it was actually hard not to fall asleep here. The main idea wasn't really that bad (long story short, the new movie tried to focus on Zamunda instead of Queens), but writing is so terrible that... seriously, how many people worked on the story and screenplay here?Coming 2 America (the one who came up with the title alone should be punished) is one of those movies where some random people talk about some random stuff and you just sit there, wondering why in the freakin' world should you care and when this torture will finally end. Watching this movie? It's like visiting your distant relatives. It's kinda boring, it's kinda awkward and you can't stop thinking about just how much you want to go home. And guess what? The movie is almost two hours long, so I'm really glad that I watched it at home where it was easy to take a break and do some more exciting stuff. Like watching the paint dry, for example. Watching this movie in one sit? It's plain boring. Sure, humor is a subjective thing, but while I laughed all the time while watching the original (still do), this time? I didn't even smile once. It's THAT uninspired. Every time there was an attempt for a joke, I was like \"good grief, seriously?\". The original impact so-o-o ins't here...Also, it's a bit too woke. In a bad way. I mean, don't get me wrong. I like woke stuff. Adds quite a lot to the impact, as long as the writing is right. Then again, you know how it is. There are times when such stuff feels natural. When it does make you care. And there are times when it feels painfully forced, out of the place and actually plays against the writing. You can't just make things interesting and exciting just by saying the right things, you know? You need a good writing to make people feel involved. Here? It feels like nobody even cared. They took one of the most popular comedy movies from eighties, they've tried to re-create some of the most famous parts (like those scenes in the barber shop), they've tried to copy / past some of the old jokes (without much success since, like I said, the original impact is long gone), they've added some woke stuff just because it's a right thing to do and BOOM! Your new Amazon Prime movie is ready. Seriously, guys, those female Ghostbusters were more funny and exciting than this. And I never thought I'll say that. Like... ever!The only thing I actually liked was Akeem's daughters (one of which is played by Eddie Murphy's real daughter, Bella), but guess what? They've barely used the characters. Seriously, even though there was, like, a ton of potential, the girls barely appeared at the beginning and near the end of the movie. While the rest of the thing was just our painfully generic stuff from all those Eddie Murphy movies nobody really cared about. You know, Dr. Dolittle, Nutty Professor... I really wonder if the man is cursed, or something. After the initial success in movies like 48 Hrs., Trading Places and Beverly Hills Cop, the movies with him started to feel EXTREMELY forced in uninspired. And this one? Heck, even Meet Dave was more funny than this.Not only Coming 2 America was unable to repeat the original success, it's also one of those sequels that actually ruin the original quite a lot. Not only it's forced and isn't funny at all, it ended up ruining good old characters. Lisa McDowell, for example, feels absolutely terrible now, while Cleo barely have a reason to appear. Not only this movie won't make you laugh, there's a big chance it'll actually make you feel sad. Just because seeing a great movie from your childhood being ruined in such a poor way? It's... you know... SAD. Dixi.\n",

With in minutes it was clear this was not going to be the movie I thought it was going to be, and by the end the consensus was that we had just watched a pretty awful movie. There is almost no plot and what plot there is is the most contrite drivel you could imagine. This is a movie you have seen at least two dozen times and out of those 23 were a better movie that this. The acting is stiff, even from the usually fantastic Michael B Jordan, there is zero character development and you have no investment in how anything turns out. There is literally probably less than 10 minutes of action and what is there is unimaginative and boring. I love action movies and think that even a lot of lower budget poorly made ones at least have some worthwhile parts, but with this movie I can honestly say that there isn't one thing I could point to in this movie that had any entertainment value.

Maybe he will be good before his corruption in later books, but no, this story has him outed as a villain in the first spoken scenes.Here ends any relation to the Tom Clancy storylines. And my interest in the story wavered further and further as the film progressed.Add in a few action sequences, lots of meaningless jibber jabber to set up a plot line that has descended from retiring seal, to covert ops, although for which agency is strangely lacking. Maybe it's cia, but none of it fits any notion of a military or intelligence structure.Acting: Jamie Bell lacks any depth, motivation and background. The actress playing Greer is to be avoided, basically, a wooden character with presence which isn't utilised at all, seems like a missed opportunity. Michael B Jordan, is limited to silent operative and angry husband and superman, but there is no depth.Just weird.... Thats some of the actions and set peices, bits of floor that fall away, climbing into burning cars to interview suspects, arrests that don't make sense, threats and hostility for show., when Kelly is imprisoned for unknown reasons, no trial, with russian mobsters. The panache of Clancy is nowhere to be seen, what we see is corruption everywhere, action scenes which are just plain non sensical, such as Kelly vs 3 Prision Guards in full riot gear with helmets, shields and batons, you can guess it's never going to be a fair match, Kelly is of course an overwhelming opponent.I honestly couldn't tell you what i detested more about this film....

The identity politics, 0/10.Overall, the key to Tom Clancy novels making it well to the screen, is to have some tenet of link back to the books, some have been very faithful, HFROctober, Patriot Games, etc. Some have been weak - SOAFears.... Some have been unfaithful, the recent amazon Jack Ryan shows, but were true to the moral of an Analyst working their way up.... This film, i can only conclude, had the title and character names of some well known Clancy characters, but none of the substance or integrity or story.... Add in an act of war by America on Russian, a Jet Plane crash in which everyone survives with no injuries.... It's just garbage and not fit for the film title and characters names.I feel sorry for the careers that could well be ruined by this film. The only reason why i don't give this film 1/10, is that it's not a home movie, and it gets a 2/10 because to be fair on the cell sequence, the use of water and M B Jordan's physique is impressive.If you decide to watch this..... Good luck.\n",

If you were hoping for a Red October/ Clear and Present Danger experience you will be highly disappointed. The acting was horrible with sub standard action sequences.

Some people gather in the woods to shoot an adventurous reality show, but they soon find themselves being hunted by a group of hideous cannibals. Noteworthy is that the characterisation is boring, because all the characters are stereotypes to such an extent that one has problems deciding whether or not this film is a parody of genre, or just extremely cliché and trying to get away with it.I can conceive of the target audience of the film being either teenagers or young adults; the film only features stereotyped characters; the soundtrack is pretty limited to teenage pop-rock music; some of the experiences of the characters, prior to the gory part of the film, are simply those teenagers or young adults are likely to experience.I guess Henry Rollins is the true hero of this film and the only reason why I am not giving this film a 1/10 vote. Amidst poor effects and even poorer acting, Henry Rollins contributes in a great way to this film with his Ramboish cliché character.Even if you are looking for a film which requires no thought whatsoever, I would not recommend this film.3/10\n",

Pounds worth of explosives blow up by the good guys powerful enough to blow out brick walls - but the good guys are ok. Multiple snipers miss shots I could make, from the building across the street.Tom Clancy movies are generally well developed and very detail oriented. No details of what the team is going to do and how there going to do it are shared with the audience. They just hop in a plane and go for it like it's a low budget action film. Cmon, the secretary of defense and head of the CIA aren't going to meet in a field trailer and make decisions, in person, directly to special forces.Who is on the special forces team?

            "Review: All right, this film has a hearing actress playing the Deaf character. Of course, there are many Deaf actors and actresses who can more or less speak. Marlee Matlin comes to mind. Why was the hearing actress cast for the Deaf character?The signing skills between two actresses are medicore. They appear to have learn the sign language from the ASL dictionary a few days prior to the shooting. Thus, they do not sign fluently and naturally. Some signs they use are incorrect for the certain words.What's more, the term, \"deaf and mute\", is used to describe her. For a long time, the Deaf community has worked hard in educating the hearing community how archaic and offensive this term along with \"deaf and dumb\" is now. The Deaf people can communicate through the sign language or other forms of communication if they don't use voice or hear. Just don't call them \"deaf and mute\" or \"deaf and dumb\"! It's same for the \"hearing impaired\" in the plot and synopsis. This term denotes the medical condition that indicates something is wrong with them and needs the intervention through surgery (cochlear implants, etc.) or through oralism (speech therapy, lipreading, and hearing training, etc.). Deaf people don't like this term at all because there's nothing wrong with them per se.Now, about the film. This horror flick is highly formulaic and repetitive: evil spirit is trapped in the object and is released when somebody accidentally or intentionally breaks the seal. The Catholic Church delegates come to investigate the \"miracles\" and end up exploiting the \"miracles\" for their own gain. Nothing new under the sun.This film has higher-than-usual 8, 9, and 10 stars with very short reviews. In other words, those reviewers are paid to post the \"excellent\" reviews for the medicore film with equally medicore CGI and acting. I would have given the film at least five stars if it wasn't for miscast of hearing actress, for poor signing skills, and for the offensive terms.\n",

Very poor execution of a non-speaking protagonist!Also, I really hoped he had some background for example his wife and kid(s) were killed but he somehow survived and returned to avenge their deaths, or maybe he was a kid that witnessed some killings taking place and had so much trauma he couldn't speak after it - NOT! Not a single scene where ANY of his behavior is explained. The moments when he's so much sticking to his schedule and letting the kids die really angered me too.

            "Review: The Unholy (2021) is written, co-produced and directed by Evan Spiliotopoulos in his directorial debut, based on the 1983 novel Shrine by James Herbert. Produced by Sam Raimi through its Ghost House Pictures banner, it stars Jeffrey Dean Morgan, Katie Aselton, William Sadler, Diogo Morgado, Cricket Brown, and Cary Elwes.Being one of the first major horror releases of 2021, The Unholy comes with a fairly interesting concept. After seeing the trailer I thought such a concept could lead to some thought provoking subject matter. But this does boil down to being a pretty textbook and bland movie. A spirit has influence over somebody, can our hero exorcise the demon?The acting is pretty good. Silly things happen like, a character walking into a room and finding a book that tells them the entire history of the demon, he does research in the archives and finds out some insignificant information that's supposed to add new depth to the story but doesn't. The monster looks quite awful and we only see practical FX for the monster in the final scene. The final act is brutally rushed. They completely neglected the corruption of the church plot line, terribly underdeveloped.Truthfully just not really many positive things to say about this one. Giving it a 3/10 for some occasionally solid lighting and a pretty fun scene with the priest in the confession booth.\n",

Having to crack the safe made no sense, why didn't the casino owner just tell them the combination. Apparently it's possible to survive a nuclear bomb being dropped right on top of you.

            "Review: I saw \"In the Earth\", starring Joel Fry-Yesterday, Game of Thrones_tv; Ellora Torchia-The Split_tv, Midsommar; Reece Shearsmith-The League of Gentlemen_tv, The Man You're Not and Hayley Squires-Cat On a Hot Tin Roof_2018, A Royal Night Out.This is a weird little movie that doesn't make a lot of sense. There is a warning at the beginning of the movie that says something like,'If you are photosensitive to strobe lights, this movie contains scenes that might trigger an epileptic seizure.' Ooohhhh, scary! It turns out to be more like the Blair Witch movie-an effort is made to scare you but not much is actually there. Joel plays a scientist that is traveling into the woods to meet an old colleague of his, Hayley, who has not been heard from in quite a while. She was supposed to have been working on some kind of virus cure but that's not the case. Ellora is the park ranger leading Joel into the woods-he might get lost, otherwise-when they run into Reece, who appears to have been living in the woods for a little while, himself, and has his own agenda going on. The epileptic causing scenes are mostly strobe lights going off that Hayley has set up for her experiments-she also has loud speakers attached to trees but it's just really loud noise.It's rated \"R\" for violence, grisley images and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 40 minutes.I would not buy this movie on DVD. I wouldn't rent it either. If you really have an interest in seeing it, I would wait until it's on basic cable tv.\n",

Than the movie turns to a bit better to be honest, it even has a few good lines. Next the slaughter began, and the movie was going a bit clumsy, some good, some bad, but watchable, even on moments inventive and entertaining. During this \"improved\" period I became more and more aware of the B-production and really bad acting excluding Henry Rollins who did a good job. While the movie was slowly turning a bit repetitive and boring with every next scene, I feel the director tear the screenplay in pieces and burned them, and start to pour everywhere He manages extra fake blood, guts, livers, hearts and all the organs you can think off, I think He even probably borrowed or stole from somewhere extra fakes.I mean how much blood and guts can one man or woman have, that combined with the unbearable bad acting and now already with ridiculous lines, goofs, lack of direction or logic, became funny, I started to laugh out loud while the pieces of people were all around, I laughed to the director and people who praised this garbage.\n",

Well not this one, although he isn't really the star of this movie which qualifies as the most boring exorcism movie I've ever seen. It plays like a really mediocre pilot to a bad TV series that will be canceled mid-season. Everything about it is off, there is nothing scary or suspenseful, the gore is bland, it's obvious that the film makers have no clue as to how to film horror. At times it was bad in a campy way that had me laughing, a bad sign while watching a horror/thriller. To top it off Vadhir Derbez , the real lead, has to be one of the most dreary actors ever. Either he was given poor direction on how to play his part or he's just naturally an awful actor. The plot is filled with holes, a certain twist I guessed early on, the writing is lazy, scenes that could have worked with some build-up had none and worst of all I struggled to stay awake.

Instead they chose to walk in the woods with a zombie hulk chasing them. Wow hats off to the writers of the movie.Why did scott just readily accepted the offer of 50 million and didn't demanded more.Why ( a big why) did the boss remained quiet and didn't gave them safe's codes or told them about the booby traps.How were they so sure that the helicopter would still fly and didn't cared much about the weight of the money and the passengers.When the first girl died, why she didn't told her boyfriend about the traitor. There was plenty of time for her to spit it out and save many lives.How come no one said anything when they found out that there were many teams before them who just happened to die in the casino and near the safe. Any sane person would had got the hell out of there after learning that secret.Why on earth the boss's man ( with the queen's head) went outside the building and not on the roof to the helicopter.Why didn't the team had not one single silencer with them. It would be so easy to just kill the zombie tiger, the queen, the other alpha zombie in the beginning and get over with it. And that too without alerting anyone.

            "Review: Apart from its intriguing premise, the hopelessly predictable, live-action, sci-fi saga \"Voyagers\" (*1/2 OUT OF ****) has little else to distinguish it. First, climate change has ravaged the planet, and the Earth is deteriorating at an alarming rate. Man is running out of time as well as resources! Second, the nearest planet fit for human habitation requires an 86-year voyage! Incredibly, serious minds decide to launch children into space and educate them so they can maintain their spacecraft during this voyage of a lifetime. Later, when they have matured enough, they will reproduce and then train their offspring! Presumably, these first-generation space travelers will apprise the second generation, their sons and daughters, about the dire necessity for colonizing the new planet. Undoubtedly, teens will applaud the confidence mankind has entrusted them with for such a critical mission. Nevertheless, just as parents dread the thought of teens sneaking out for a spin in the family sedan, space agency administrators are just as paranoid about their decision to let everything ride on these teenagers. Ultimately, a space program veteran volunteers to chaperone the thirty young adults dispatched for the stars. Inevitably, you can imagine the deceptive measures which man has taken to keep those young minds focused on the mission. Not only does \"Voyagers\" writer & director Neil Burger know something about YA movies, but he also helmed \"Divergent\" (2014) and was executive producer on both sequels \"Insurgent\" (2015) and \"Allegiant\" (2016), a futuristic film franchise based on Veronica Roth's bestselling novels.\"Voyagers\" is set in 2063. Since the trip is an estimated 86-year journey, scientists have assembled a crew from scratch. Thirty test-tube babies--the bioengineered seed of MIT scientists and Nobel laureates--have been incubated in a remote laboratory under close medical scrutiny. These infants are confined for the duration of their stay. They never see either the sun or the moon. They aren't taken for rides in strollers to experience the seasons. Psychologists fear any exposure to either the world or humanity could jeopardize the mission. Similarly, they are concerned about the mission commander, Richard (Colin Farrell of \"Miami Vice\"), the accomplished scientist who mentored these gifted youngsters. He is as close as they will ever come to having a parent. He says he can wave goodbye to Earth with few regrets. Indeed, Richard realizes he is taking a one-way trip, but the prospect doesn't frighten him. Nevertheless, he finds himself at a disadvantage when his young cadets bug him with nuisance questions about the mission. When they turn twenty, they approach him with pesky inquiries that make Richard furrow his brow in dread. Literally, these cadets fit British philosopher John Locke's essay about humans at birth being blank slates called tabula rasa. They know nothing more than what their particular culture has programmed into them.Meantime, inquisitive Chris (Tye Sheridan of \"Ready Player One\") and his best buddy Zac (Fionn Whitehead of \"Dunkirk\") discover that their popular beverage, nicknamed \"The Blue,\" which everybody guzzles like tap water, is laced with mysterious chemicals. Indeed, Mission Control has them on a regimen of anti-depressants to minimize any personality disorders. Chris and Zac boycott 'the Blue,' and they experience a radical change. They compete with greater vigor when wrestling since they can muster more strength and tenacity. Eventually, the other cadets follow their example. Before long, Richard finds himself at odds with Chris over this thorny issue. When the ship's communications system breaks down, Richard orders Chris to assist him with a spacewalk to repair the damage. Initially, Zac was assigned to help him, but Richard punishes Zac for groping their medical officer, Sela (Lily-Rose Depp of \"Tusk\"), without her consent. Afterward, Richard promises Chris to contact Mission Control about the chemicals in their water supply. Unfortunately, Richard dies from an apparent heart attack. Although the cadets elected Chris as their new leader, they shirk their duties. The friendly rivalry between Chris and Zac reaches a breaking point, and they become bitter enemies. Pandemonium ensues, and the crew turn against each other. Despite Chris's reminder that survival is their first priority, Zac foments an uprising, and his faction raids the weapons arsenal.Sadly, like a pupil plagiarizing a book report on English author William Golding's Nobel Prize-winning novel \"Lord of the Flies,\" Burger has simply swapped out the island setting of Golding's classic with a spaceship. Sadly, studio executives who never read Golding's book but were eager to corner the market signed onto Burger's premise. Presumably, Burger didn't cite Golding because \"Voyagers\" added women to the narrative and outer space served as the setting. Mind you, \"Voyagers\" does a competent job of setting up the situation and getting through the sticky preliminaries. \"Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2\" production designer Scott Chambliss and Burger have created a sleek, sterile, state-of-the-art spacecraft, but neither the vessel's name nor numerical designation is ever revealed. White is the dominant color. Considering the width of its cramped corridors, the spacecraft seems rather claustrophobic. Lugging oversized space equipment along those passageways would pose a challenge. Two people cannot walk side by side without brushing shoulders. The cadets wind up pushing a plethora of buttons on sophisticated consoles and ogle monitors galore, so \"Voyagers\" never lets you forget it is tech savvy.\"Voyagers\" might have fared better as a goofy sex comedy. Imagine something like \"Porky's\" (1981) mashed up with \"Spaceballs\" (1987)! Up to a point, \"Voyagers\" floats several provocative ideas. Alas, the filmmakers don't follow through with anything genuinely original. Not only can you guess the identity of their new leader after Richard's demise, but also the inevitable 'happily ever after' outcome occurs once Zac's rebellion is quashed. After order has been restored but before the end credits roll, you won't be surprised at who is elected to replace Chris.

How could Ben Falcone cast an Oscar winner in a poorly made film? Everything from pre-production to post-production was rushed, which is unacceptable in Hollywood.

            "Review: If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Ben Falcone and Melissa McCarthy, husband and wife, have been making movies together since the former began his filmmaking career. Literally, every film directed, written, and/or produced by Falcone has the famous actress in the lead role, all exploring subgenres of comedy. From romance (Superintelligence) to crime (The Happytime Murders), without forgetting a road trip (Tammy), now comes the time for Thunder Force, a dive into the highly profitable superhero circle. However, I don't believe the couple's real goal is to deliver a globally liked movie. Actually, I firmly defend that their purpose is to provide the most nonsensical piece of storytelling possible, hoping that viewers find it entertaining enough.Directors, screenwriters, actors, and every other crew member... a vast majority aspire to deliver a groundbreaking masterpiece. A film recognized by everyone as \"remarkable cinema\". Something worthy of many Oscars, Golden Globes, and much more. Movies like Thunder Force aren't made to receive regular nominations, but instead, to try and be present at the Razzies - both Falcone and McCarthy have been quite successful in this achievement. While the actress continuously shows her undeniable talent that would be better employed in other films - such as Can You Ever Forgive Me? And Bridesmaids - the writer-director continues to put together awfully dull movies.To be completely honest, the first act of Thunder Force is surprisingly decent. The setup to the main narrative is interesting enough, and the comedy peak is reached during the first half-hour. The massive problem is that this peak offers no more than a couple of chuckles occasionally. From the start of the second act until the very end, Falcone embarrassingly fails to offer genuine laughs. The tone is ridiculously out-of-balance, with almost every scene being a forced attempt at humor, even when the moment doesn't ask for it. Incredibly flat - and some disgusting - jokes are repeated throughout the film, which ends up dragging an already stretched out runtime.The superhero plot is as generic and predictable as it could be in a movie that makes no effort in trying to do something remotely different than what viewers have seen for the last couple of decades. The VFX look like they came from an amateur studio as if Netflix didn't even care about its own product. Story-wise, there's not even a proper way of analyzing such a silly screenplay. In one moment, it seems to be taking a specific scene seriously, but a couple of minutes later, everything is back to the annoyingly dumb environment. Don't get me wrong: if there's a type of humor I absolutely adore is absurd comedy, but it needs to be done properly, with the right people and the right story.In the end, I usually tend to have a light hand in films like this. Thunder Force is just another addition to the never-ending list of \"forgettable movies\", which isn't something that really bothers me. It's exactly what everyone expects it to be, which can work as a compliment if people want to. The most frustrating aspect of all of this is watching McCarthy and Octavia Spencer - two outstanding actresses with five Oscar nominations combined, including a win for the latter in The Help - working on hopeless projects such as this one. It begs the famous question: why?Thunder Force is yet another piece of pointless, absurd storytelling from Ben Falcone, featuring unbearably dry, forced humor, besides a forgettable story. A film that cross-checks every requirement for a Razzies contender, something quite familiar for the writer-director and his wife, Melissa McCarthy, who keeps doing favors. Despite an admittedly decent first act, the rest of the film goes downhill concerning its entertainment value. Honestly, I don't know what's worse: witnessing McCarthy and Octavia Spencer waste her exceptional talent in nonsensical movies or seeing major studios continue to give opportunities to filmmakers that have nothing important to say while necessary, significant voices are still out there waiting desperately for their shot. The best compliment I can give this Netflix product is that it doesn't mislead anyone: it's precisely what viewers expect it to be, whether that's nice or horrible.Rating: D.\n",

Maybe someone in Hollywood has it in for him, but he's just now getting the good parts any more and the slide into trashy, low budget poorly written parts reaches a new low with this one.This is the sort of film you would expect from a film student or a bunch of wannabe film makers who fancy themselves the next Michael Bay. Its poorly written, very poorly directed, poorly scripted, poorly choreographed, and poorly shot.There is really not point going into details, but if you want to know how not to make a film, or if your a lecturer highlighting the poor use of resources for film making to your students, you could well use this as a great example.Cage has no lines in this film, and I mean NONE, and if you are going to make a film where the lead character has no lines, it had better be a fantastic screenplay, This most certainly isn't and the attempt at a quirky implementation falls completely flat.I'd say see it just for the experience, but even that would be a waste of time.\n",

What it advertised was a horror movie of the purest form; man with an axe, body horror, perhaps pagan ritualism? It really sold the movie, didn't it? So how did the final product end up being so damn boring?The movie starts out fine, and although things are dreadfully slow, it sets the scene for act 2. That's where things really fall apart. The movie nosedives off a steep cliff and falls so heavily, I'm surprised focus groups didn't tear this movie to shreds when it was first screened.Who was this movie made for. Exactly? Fans of horror will be sorely disappointed, as there is very little of it to be scared of. Body horror? Bits and pieces (no pun intended). Pagan ritualism? Yes, but it factors very little into the overall film. It's just a mess of a movie that is saved by the great acting and the unnerving musical score, and that's literally it. When the movie ended, I rushed to scrub it from my memory with an actually good film.It's bad, people. Just utterly horrid in almost all respects. It will test your patience, and you will not come out of it better than you went into it. Movies like these are an obvious exercises in creative vanity; make a movie that you know most people are going to hate simply because you can and no one around you tells you just how bad it will ultimately be.

In this case the story of Basil Brown is fundamentally true. Well done! The film is beautifully shot, the atmosphere of pre-war Suffolk is captured in subtle muted colours and the local accent is accurately portrayed. Treat it as a film, and you will love it. However if you look for the facts, you will find many variances. In particular you will discover that Peggy's liaison is fictional, and the two actual photographers were omitted. The one startling omission, for which the film loses a star, is that the magnificent artefacts now in the British Museum are not shown, just a few grubby bits of metal. It is beyond my belief that such a good director could miss this punch-line just before the credits.\n",

            "Review: Of all the evil witches, monsters, dictators, and homicidal maniacs that populated classic Disney animation, Cruella Deville might be the most hated. Sure, she never had plans for world domination and she never even tried to murder another human, but she did the one thing that film audiences can never forgive: she tried to kill puppies. It's for this reason that I've been so skeptical about this film, an origin story that attempts to humanize this character by shedding new light on her turbulent past. The cast sounded stacked and Craig Gillespie is a director I've admired ever since \"Lars and the Real Girl,\" but was it possible to tell a sympathetic, Disney-fied story about someone we know will wind up a would-be dog killer?Well, the answer is yes and no, but mostly yes. Before I praise this film for being such an unexpected gem, let me get the couple of problems I have with it out of the way. First and foremost, without giving any spoilers, I never get the true sense that Cruella is as pure evil as she's supposed to be by the time we get to 101 Dalmatians. She's definitely no hero by any means, but there's not a point where I feel the audience will stop rooting for her. The only other complaint is that there's a bit of a tonal inconsistency at times, as if the film doesn't quite know its target audience. It's certainly not for children, not only is it dark and mature but it's so much of a character study that young kids would be bored, yet there are certain occasions that feature very \"cartoonish\" logic that adults will have to suspend a lot of disbelief over.But on to the good, and the first point of praise is the cast. Emma Stone is absolutely brilliant in this role, and you can just sense that she's having the time of her life playing it. Almost just as amazing is Emma Thompson as the vile Baroness, and when the two are onscreen together the chemistry between the rivals is electric. As far as the supporting cast goes, there really isn't a weak link to be found, with a particular stand out in Paul Walter Hauser who is hilarious as the dimwitted thief Horace. As for Gillespie's direction, the film is beautifully shot and he brings the same stylistic energy he brought to \"I,Tonya\" though it's greatly enhanced here due to the 1970s punk rock aesthetic of the film. This leads me to the soundtrack, which is not only pure awesomeness, but is used to turn Cruella's story into an almost allegory for the transition of London music scene in the late 60s-early 70s.I could go on and on about the individual components that make this film work, but the truth is what really makes it work is how well these individual parts come together in a seamless fashion (no pun intended). In another time perhaps I might be more critical, but honestly it's been a while since I've seen such a major studio blockbuster, especially one based on an established property, that feels like it's actually the unaltered vision of a filmmaker. The story, the cast, the music, the style, everything all fits together to make something truly satisfying. That's how movies are supposed to be made, and with that I give this my first strong recommend of 2021.\n",

            "Review: Dale (Herny Rollins) is the host of a TV Reality Show titled \"Apocalyspe\". Which Dale, the director (Matthew Currie Holmes) and the producer (Aleksa Palladino) are choosing six different contestants (Erica Leerhsen, Texas Battle, Daniella Alonso, Steve Braun, Crystal Lowe and Kimberly Caldwell) to play a \"Survivor\" type-game but they find themselves battling a ugly bunch of inbred cannibals. Which these \"freaks\" are planning to kill them off one by one.Directed by Joe Lynch made an agreeable sequel to the cult horror favorite \"Wrong Turn\". Which the original wasn't much of a success in theaters but it went on to do well on DVD. The cast seems to be having a great time here, the gore effects are well-done but the inbred looking cannibals are not as successful as Four-Time Oscar Winner:Stan Winston's original make-up design on the original.The Unrated DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (1.85:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD includes two commentary tracks. Commentary one is by the director, actors:Leerhsen & Rollins. Commentary two is by the screenwriters:Turi Meyer and Al Stepien. Which the writers are best-known for writing B-Movie scripts like \"Candyman:Day of the Dead\", \"Leprechaun 2\" and \"Sleepstalker\". DVD also includes two featurettes, a small brief behind the scenes of the infamous \"incestous\" cannibals love scene and a trailer. This \"Direct to Video\" Sequel DVD is better than expected, a few flaws here and there but nothing serious. Fans of the original will probably enjoy this one more. Wayne Robson as the mysterious old-timer is back in the sequel. \"Three Fingers\" Character from the original is played by a different actor here. The lead cannibal \"Pa\" is played by Ken Kirzinger. Which Kirzinger is best known for playing \"Jason Voorhees\" in \"Freddy Vs. Jason\". (*** ½/*****).\n",

            "I forgot who said this but I saw someone say that Malcolm & Marie is not a love story but instead a story about love. That seems so simple but it's so so true. Who thought that perspective would make a romance like this so profound. Because this film is profound. All we have are two people, two people in a relationship, who love each other tear each other apart, put each other back together again and then continue this cycle all in the course of one night. I'll compare it to Marriage Story in that there is no bias on either counterpart, there are times you side with Malcolm and there are time where you side with Marie. That's the key to a great romance especially when you are showing a love affair with cracks beginning to show.\n",
            "The fact both of these characters are artists in their own right makes emotions even stronger because as an artists you feel things in varying levels. Sometimes more strongly sometimes less so, sometimes your art will tie you together and connect you like nothing else but it can just as easily break you. In this context it adds another layer to a complex relationship and that's why for me it just struck a core more so than anything I've seen for a very very long time. Therefore I may be biased towards this film however you can't lie it captures love in a raw and unfiltered way that hurts like a knife to the heart but you would never want to be without it.\n",
            "Technically this film is a flourish of effective understatement, with the bold use of black and white and strongly framed shots. The script is just insane and although music isn't used much and it's played within the world of the film instead of underscoring the action it fits so well. Also it would be criminal of me to not mention just how amazing Zendaya and John David Washington are. Neither of them outshine each other, they light each other up on screen and leave everything on the floor. Landmark performances from them both.\n",

This film avoids all the traps of traditional biopics. Its tight timeline and electric performances distinguished it from similar stories that wind up feeling like nothing more than historical dramatization. I knew how this movie would end. I knew the basic story of the main character. And yet I hung on every moment. Kaluuya is that good, and Stanfield is that good. More importantly, the filmmakers are smart enough to figure out that this could be a story of betrayal, advocacy, loyalty, and fear...something that transcended one person's story. What results is something both universal and uniquely relevant to the present day. This movie deserves whatever awards it wins.\n",

Deke, a small-town deputy previously banished from LA returns to his old beat to retrieve evidence needed for a small case in his new life. While waiting for evidence to clear, he becomes marginally involved in a case being handled by Jimmy Baxter, a series of killings eerily similar to the case that sent him packing years before. The unlikely pair manage to pool their talents to move the investigation forward and identify a suspect. As in all good mysteries, nothing, including the strongest suspect, is what it appears, and Little Things becomes a redemption story in a tale where none of the heroes are innocent.\n",

From Carey Mulligan and Ralph Fiennes to Ben Chaplin and Archie Barnes, the performances are all first-rate. The real-life story is told with great finesse, and filmed earnestly with a keen eye for production details. I have to say, even some of the lesser moments from the film shall stay with me for long, its appeal is that strong.\n",

            "Review: Wrong turn 2 for me was great, the violence wasn't disappointing and the actors weren't TOO bad. The film is about 6 reality stars who go on a reality show for a 100,000 dollared prize but there are cannibals who are very hungry. The film opening is great, Kimberly doesn't do very well before she is easily killed gruesomely. The other characters are: Nina (Gothic girl), Jake (Jockey), Dale (Ex marine), Amber (Marine), Elena (Slut), Jonesy (Skater), Mara (Average girl), M (Mara's boyfriend). All the characters are obvious ones, they all play a certain role and you get to know them pretty well. Surprisingly Mara is killed of pretty quick getting an axe to the head, The slut is then killed after flashing her boobs for a few seconds, she is then killed by the cannibal sister being stabbed several times in the back in a lake, revealing her spine (not nice). Amber and Jonesy are killed together, Dale sadly is killed gruesomely and M is killed (no-one cares about him though as he cheats on Mara with Elena).Altogether the film is pretty good and i recommend it.\n",

I mean there are so many awesome STV movies out there, and Wrong Turn 2 is on that list. I mean it's just so awesome! There are some very bloody deaths, great acting (Erica Leerhsen, Aleksa Palladino and Crystal Lowe are awesome!), and the killers are frightening! They are very deformed and look horrible, and you just want to scream when you see them, which is good of course. Really, believe me, this film is great and it rocks big time! The story is a bit silly, yes, but it isn't really important in the movie and it disappears very quickly, so if anyone hates the plot, you can relax because it isn't even in the movie that much! Oh, and I have to say that I was shocked when I saw one character die in the film because I thought she would live, and that death made the film awesome and unpredictable! So I say, people see it and ignore that it went direct-to-video because it's better than most movies that went to theaters!\n",

            "Review: For a rom com with modest ambitions, I found it extremely enjoyable. One reviewer criticized the characters as lacking in flaws, but that made it feel more real to me. The characters have flaws, but most real life young adults are pretty good people and aren't boiling over with so much drama that they end up yelling at each other before kissing each other in a thunderstorm. I think it had more emotional depth for the lack of heightened drama, not less, and is challenging cinema norms in a very needed way. Not all of film needs to be soap opera and Shakespearian theater. There is a place for grounded portrayal of ordinary people, because in the end real life is bigger than our imaginations. When Hollywood is drowning us in fake or cheap drama, this has the potential to be revolutionary. I hope it has influence.\n",

            "Review: Summary:Oxygen is much more than a film about confinement or a mere claustrophobic exercise that takes place in real time: it is a spatial elegy that tells us about the indissoluble relationship between identity and memory, about the anguished reconstruction of the latter and that at the same time time that wears elegant and sober high-tech devices, lavishes moments of ineffable poetry and more than one epiphany.It is another of those films with many merits (and undeniable affiliations) that instead of analyzing it for what it is, some criticize it for what it is not or for what it \"should be\".Review:The film begins with Elizabeth Hansen (MÃ©lanie Laurent) \"waking up\" in a cryogenic capsule that has a virtual medical assistant called MILO (in the voice of Mathieu Amalric) who informs her that due to a technical malfunction, the oxygen levels in the module are dropping. Constantly. But who is Elizabeth? Why is she there? Where is that capsule? The protagonist will look for answers and a possible way out of her distressing situation.Oxygen is another of those films with many merits that instead of analyzing it for what it is, some criticize it for what it is not or what it should be according to them or establish superficial comparisons or affiliations with others. It is an intimate science fiction film where the protagonist must face an initial situation of absolute confusion (she does not know who she is, or where she is or why), as if her awakening were a new birth, a chrysalis trying to get out of her confinement. That is why Oxygen is much more than a film about the confinement or a mere claustrophobic exercise.The film takes place in real time inside the capsule and constitutes for the protagonist a strenuous exercise of rebuilding her identity from memory (with her exterior screenshots), interacting with the friendly but relentlessly algorithmic MILO (reminiscent of the HAL of 2001 but also of current virtual assistants)The director Alexandre Aja knows how to make the most of the successful design of the capsule and skilfully does not incur repetitions (filming in such a narrow location is a challenge) counting on the great performance of Laurent (in a true tour de force acting ).If we have to look for affiliations, I would point to Gravity and 7500 (which takes place almost entirely in an airplane cabin) and others that I cannot reveal, although in this case the coordinates are clearly futuristic science fiction.There is in this film a certain ineffable poetry and more than one epiphanic moment, aided by ROB's remarkable electronic music.Oxygen is a spatial elegy that has all the resources to move the viewer.\n",

            "Review: My Review- CruellaMy Rating 9/10I had a hunch Cruella would appeal to my taste when I saw the trailer but that often can be a disappointment but not in this case.Cruella excelled for me in all Departments Script, Set Design, Costumes Performances and most importantly entertainment value.What a superb pairing of Acting talents the dynamic duo of Emma's with Emma Thompson as The Baroness and Emma Stone as Estella and later Cruella DeVil .Both these fine Actresses are Oscar Winners and both show why they are winners in Cruella , each in equal costarring roles.The blending and chemistry between these two women is so obvious as is the fun they must have both had in performing their respective roles.It's interesting to note that another great actress who portrayed Cruella DeVil ,Glenn Close is an executive producer on this project.I couldn't help comparing these two devilish characters to Raveena the Wicked Queen in Snow White and Emma Stone's character to Harley Quinn colliding in a Devil Wears Prada fantasy for adults and children alike .If you have a bit of a Camp sense of humour and appreciate superb Costumes by double Oscar winner and ten time nominated Costume designer Jenny Beavan plus a great escapist romp you'll love Cruella I'm sure.I think while children over say 10 may enjoy Cruella it's an Adult fantasy comedy Fairy Tale , very inspired I suspect by Ronald Dahl's style of madness and mayhem.\"Cruella,\" is set in 1970s London amidst the punk rock revolution, and follows a young grifter named Estella, a clever and creative girl determined to make a name for herself with her fashion designs. After traumatic events that see her alone and defenceless in London Estella is befriended by a pair of young thieves who appreciate her appetite for mischief and individuality. Joel Fry as Jasper and Paul Walter Hauser as Horace have some of the best comedic moments in Cruella as two street wise ruffians who like nothing more than to \"Pick a Pocket or two. They form a trio with young Cruella assisting her with her quest to be a fashion designer by devious means in gaining her employment at the famous \"Liberty\" Department Store.Estella's flair for fashion catches the eye of the Baroness von Hellman, a fashion legend who is devastatingly chic and terrifyingly haute, played by 2-time Oscar winner Emma Thompson. Emma Thompson has never looked so chic her sense of comedy timing with sarcastically cruel one liners is superb .The Baroness and her best new fashion designer Estella's relationship sets in motion a course of events and revelations that will cause Estella to embrace her wicked side and become the raucous, fashionable, and revenge-bent Cruella.Other standout performances in this ensemble are John McCrea as Artie ,Estella's Camp fashion ally and Mark Strong as the valet to the Baroness.The Soundtrack to Cruella is fun and enjoyable with retro pop hits plus a fun Score by Nicholas Britell to set the action along at a cracking pace.Walt Disney Pictures announced the film's development in 2013, with Andrew Gunn as producer . Emma Stone was cast in 2016 and also serves as an executive producer on the film alongside Glenn Close, who previously portrayed Cruella in the previous live-action adaptations.Cruella had a huge estimated budget of $200million so it needs to be a big hit movie for Disney and I hope this film succeeds .It must be seen on a Cinema Screen don't wait for it to stream it's such a beautiful production and it's creativity needs to be seen as intended on a giant screen.Based on the book 101 Dalmations by Dodie Smith the 5 screenplay writers Steve Zisses, Kelly Marcel, Aline Brosch McKenna, Tony McNamarra, and Dana Fox have done a wonderful job at melding the prequel to Cruella DeVil to the classic 101 Dalmstions and possible sequels .\n",

            "This true story is a violent slap in the face, as things have not changed since then and reminds us of the extent to which injustice, political bashings and an oppressive police force are still on the rise. Numerous archive images slipped throughout the film illustrate this drama and its issues which unfortunately have not aged 50 years. Any attempt to emancipate the people from the system is systematically drowned out by a minority of powerful wishing to preserve their way of life by using endless methods of division, stigmatization, and mounted blows, including assassinations.

            "Review: An intriguing little piece of British history, The Dig tells a slow-burning story with understated and genuine drama throughout, turning what could have been a rather dry tale of archaeology into a genuinely gripping character drama. Its historical context takes a little while to become fully relevant, but ultimately, The Dig really proves itself as a captivating watch.One of the things that I really liked about The Dig was its patience. Never dragging yet never rushing, the film takes its time to build up all of its main strengths, from its characters, their emotional back stories, and the overarching historical context of the outbreak of World War II.Complete with elegant camerawork, a beautiful score and impressively atmospheric direction that makes it an eye-catching watch from the first few moments, The Dig has enough confidence and depth to keep you engrossed even if its story isn't advancing apace, something that's a lot harder to pull off than you may think.One of the big reasons that the film's patient pacing and style work so well is because of its understated, genuine drama. With calm yet fully convincing performances across the board, particularly from Ralph Fiennes and Carey Mulligan, this isn't a showy period drama by any means, but eases you into a story about real people, making them the centre of attention far more than the historical significance of the event.I'm not particularly well-versed in archaeology, and I didn't know about this discovery before watching this film. I think that might be the case for many other people, but the great thing about The Dig is that it's primarily a character-driven drama, and one that uses emotional intrigue to bring you closer to the story at hand and allow you to appreciate its importance.One element where the film does seem to falter is in its use of the historical backdrop of the lead-up to World War II. Set in the summer months of 1939 before the outbreak of war, there are sporadic references to the coming conflict through the first two acts of the movie, but they don't seem to bear much relevance to this story about an archaeological find.However, the film slowly begins to unveil how the historical context plays into its characters' personal lives and the fate of the dig itself, with dramatic focus shifting significantly in the final act, but just at the right point that the sudden arrival of the war into everyday life feels just like what it would have been like to experience it first-hand, taking over everything seemingly normal in an instant.As a result, while the historical backdrop seems almost contrived at first, it really comes good as the film progresses, another demonstration of how the patience of The Dig really plays into its hands throughout.\n",

The storyline focuses on a scientist and a Ranger's trip into the forest on a research expedition that goes terribly wrong. They find someone they hope can help them; but as we know in horror, help isn't always what it appears to be. This movie is directed by Ben Wheatley (Kill List) and stars Joel Fry (Game of Thrones), Ellora Torchia (Les Cowboys) and Reece Shearsmith (High-Rise). The storyline for this at first felt a little like Blair Witch until the researchers run into the couple that live in the woods, then this took a drastic turn for the interesting. I loved the scenes with the ax, stitching, the head bleeding special effect, the hazmat suit, the eye at the end and the main character walking with no shoes. The attention to detail was great like the quick flash of light when they're smacked in the head. I also thought the lighting and cinematography was outstanding. This is definitely one of the better horror movies of 2021 so far and I'd score this a 7.5-8/10 and strongly recommend seeing it.\n",

Films on subjects like this can be either dry or trivial or triumphalist or worthy or just bad.But from the first scenes this film is beautiful. These is no other word. The outdoor scenes (and much of it is outdoors) is just breathtakingly gorgeous at times. This is Suffolk and wow does it look good. If anyone has seen the BBC series \"The Detectorists\" they will get the idea. It captures the big skies of East Anglia so well, sun through the early morning mists, or even after the rain like works of art. The stage on which the action is set is sumptuous.As for the action - its just so good. Almost dreamlike at times - I found myself thinking of \"The Go-Between\" (also set in Suffolk, of course!) with dialogue over the top of action that is not taking place at quite the same time. Hard to describe, but its like memories.Some of the film is a shade predictable - the small enthusiast verses the big guy, the mismatched couple and a possible tragic love story, the child's eye view at times, the repressed sexuality of the period - it's all there. But it is so well done.The only downside is that this film - this photography - deserves the big screen, but most people will now see it on the small. This is such a shame. Its deserved so much more.\n",

Only because of the quality and word from mouth this film became a hit. I would really recommend whoever hasn't watched it till now to do it.Debut director Tharun Moorthy has given us an outstanding cinematic experience, with perfect background scores. This manages to make us feel convinced that this is how cyber police in Kerala works. We don't feel like any tech stuff they show is out of place. That is all one needs to ask from such a movie. When most movies show tech stuff in an incorrect way, this is breath of fresh air. It feels grounded in reality.The script doesn't lag anywhere. The comic relief we get is not at all forced and feels very organic.The acting is very good. There is no one who did their part in a bad way.You can relate every single cyber crime that is shown, as we have read about it constantly in newspapers. From \"Premam\" movie leaks to nurses being fooled lakhs of rupees to study abroad these things we have witnessed and still happen.This is what I call a movie, when you teach people about the wrongs and what I right. When the message of the movie is a sad reality in our the system that is temporary workers don't get the right opportunities, wages or salary & respect in India. That is the truthA must watch film.

So how can I describe Cherry?Cherry starts out like every good story and builds up to it, by first establishing the universe.. a post-apocalyptic world (or sum such) where recycling is important, new fashions are in play and sex robots are possible and people (at least from the characters point of view) have to have contracts to date/copulateCherry then shows us one of the first *real* female action hero's (basically Tomb Raiders Laura Croft v1.0) and some great desert and action sequences that are widely unpredictable and done wellAll the while this stories carries on with credibility and imagination, Cherry 2000 is one of the most successful B movie sci-fi's ever accomplished it's these kinds of movies that give me hope to see more.. I personally love and still love a lot of 80's movies and 80's style we have yet to recapture in our let's make it all more real setting.. I'm not saying that gems aren't still made today they are; they've just been rarer to find as of late..Since Cherry is a special vein of movies all its own it's important we list e'm - Mad Max - The Road Warrior (this one is very special) - Dead-End Drive In What I can say about Cherry after multiple viewing maybe 5-7 now in my lifetime since I first caught in cinemax or one of the movie channels one night.. is that's its very, very special.. That the story is so good that it can play catch-up or compliment movies like \"A.I.\" another one of Kubrick's unfigured out masterpieces..Normally I would say this movie is 7/10 but I'm upping my vote to 8/10 for now do to shear appreciation of this movie vs. some of the crap we have been getting these past 2 decades.. (note of course sci-fi had a great few years from about 1997 to 2001)On my last viewing this time I noticed again how good Basil Poledouris score compliments the movie..

            "The title accurately describes the relationship between \"William O'Neal\" and \"Fred Hampton\" for a brief period in the 60's before O'Neal assisted the FBI in killing Hampton.It begs the question \"does the time/moment make the man or is it vice versa\"? The probability at the time based on the events happening in the United States with race relations and Edgard Hover (then FBI director) doing everything in his power to orchestrate the deaths of black activist, naturally gave rise to a Messiah \"Hampton\" and a Judas \"O'Neal\" who would betray him.Both Daniel Kaluuya (playing Hampton) and Lakeith Stanfield (playing O'Neal) do a fantastic work embodying their characters and re-enacting them to life. Very much like the carpenter from 2000 years ago 1/3 the world still worships, Fred Hampton was indeed a Messiah that pointed out the hypocrisy in the American system and preached sermons that empowered and brought unlikely factions of people together. He frequently said \"power anywhere there's people\", a wise timeless insight.\n",

Well-shot and well-directed, it looked liked a \"high-end disagreement\", and amidst the pettiness between two lovers their environment blends well with their situation, the mood right from start glued me to my screen from start to finish.Both actors did an amazing job and huge part of it is because of the superb writing, but I see people criticizing the chemistry between Zendaya and John, and I honestly believe Zendaya is a very replaceable part of the film, but nonetheless she did great and delivered her best performance of her acting career, John is so versatile and honestly, he could be a leading man of an another romantic film.

            "Review: I found this movie to be solidly enjoyable overall. I wouldn't say that it was groundbreaking compared to the average horror move, but there were a couple of things that make it stand out as a fun and interesting watch.The first is the mixture of humour alongside the more fearful and suspenseful elements. This is one of the best things about Sam Raimi's movies-- there is often a surprising blend of fun and darkness in the tone.The second strength of the movie is its focus on the theme of cult mentalities. I liked that it dealt with this topic in a fairly believable fashion that emphasized the human elements of cult dynamics.Ultimately, I got the sense that the movie wasn't trying to take itself too seriously. It provides a reasonably satisfying story and set of character arcs, with some fun scares along the way. As long as a viewer isn't going into the movie and expecting total seriousness, then the movie should make for pretty entertaining viewing.\n",

I also do understand why this isn't a movie that will be liked by everyone, still I thought it was the most interesting discussion about race, cinema and relationships that I have ever watched on screen.It is more than a movie about relationships, there is a lot more hidden in the dialog. It is not a movie to be watched sitting back waiting for drama to escalate between the two characters until the great ending presents itself, glorious and full of emotion and absolution.I was really surprised to watch a movie like this on Netflix, and I do understand why the reviews are so low, since the people on the platform are not expecting this approach to cinema being shown in such a commoditized way.\n",

            "Review: It's so uncommon for an actor of Hopkins' talent and reputation to achieve quite possibly the best performance of his career so deep into it. He's acted brilliantly for so long and I don't mean to undermine anything he's ever accomplished in the past, but normally by now actors start phoning it in. But wow. He was not.This film was devastating to watch. In the best way possible. From the acting - which was lead by Hopkins but was not just great because of him! - to the writing, directing, scoring, editing, cinematography on and on and on everything was amazing! The only reason I did not give it a perfect 10/10 is because I so rarely give them out I'm afraid to act too rashly and give it out too soon but trust me... I may end up doing just that.As someone who has experienced the subject matter of this film personally in my family I cannot express how painfully accurate every little detail was in the writing and in Hopkins' beautiful performance. The confusion, the anger, the regret, the brutal honesty and lack of self awareness, the fear, the bipolar nature was all so frighteningly accurate that I forgot many times that I was watching a film not a documentary or even real life.I don't say this lightly.. this may not only be the best film of the past year but of the past decade.

            "Review: If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Alexandre Aja caught my attention when he delivered one of the biggest surprises of 2010, Piranha 3D. A vast majority of viewers expected that film to be absolutely awful, and while I don't exactly love it, I added the director to my list of filmmakers to follow closely. After years of trials and errors, Aja apparently found his great breakthrough with 2019's Crawl. A disaster flick that, once again, people anticipated to be one of the worst movies of the year, and it ended up as one of the very best in the genre, at least in recent memory. Therefore, I was obviously not going to miss Oxygen, a French-speaking film that boasts a highly mysterious premise.Movies like this make spoiler-free reviews really challenging to put together. This Netflix film possesses dozens of plot twists and impactful revelations that I just can't delve into, so it's tough to share my complete thoughts on the most significant moments of the movie. So, I'll work around the explicit answers to the intriguing questions that ultimately make this film incredibly captivating. Christie LeBlanc offers a fascinating screenplay packed with everything a one-location, claustrophobic, enigmatic thriller should have to be successful. Honestly, it's one of the most well-written scripts I've seen in quite a while within the genre.For those viewers who hate ambiguous movies, Oxygen is far from it. Every single question raised by the narrative is clearly answered. No viewer will leave disappointed for not understanding hidden meanings or vague themes. However, I can't state this enough: LeBlanc's screenplay holds *dozens* of questions and the same amount of answers. It's impossible to convince everyone in the audience to accept every twist, especially during the revelation-heavy third act. From a specific moment onwards, it's an overwhelming flow of shocking information that might prove too much for some spectators. Nevertheless, most viewers enjoy nitpicking something that isn't present in this film: \"movie logic\" issues.If you've seen the film already, you're either going to wholly agree with my latest statement, or you probably think we watched different movies. As usual with this type of problem, it all depends on people's perspective and mentality regarding heavy sci-fi elements or truly advanced technology. In fact, for many audiences all around the world, just the fact that Mélanie Laurent's character is stuck in a futuristic-looking cryogenic pod with a Siri-like AI helping her understand what's happening is already stretching their believability limits. Not everyone can suspend disbelief in the same way, so I won't be surprised if Oxygen receives a more divisive public response.Nevertheless, I firmly believe this will end up as one of the most overlooked/underrated films of 2021. Aja proves his tremendous talent behind the camera by making an average-length movie inside one of the tiniest places a protagonist was ever stuck in for most of the runtime. Each new block of information about the where, how, why, and when concerning the main narrative is carefully handed to the viewers with *just* the right hints to what's truly going on. Even though the audience is also imprisoned in the same place for almost two hours, Aja and Maxime Alexandre (DP) create innovative, suspenseful manners of keeping the momentum going, never letting the film feel too monotonous or tiresome.Mélanie Laurent's exceptional performance is one of the most vital elements of the movie. Without her terrific display, it would be extremely challenging to continue to feel invested in the character's mission of finding out everything that's happening to her, including who she is. Her role requires ridiculous emotional range, and Laurent demonstrates all of her immense talent. Technically, the cryogenic pod features impressive technology, some of it created by remarkable VFX. The ominous score by Robin Coudert also brings another layer of mystery and suspense to the already obscure film. Overall, it's a perfect example of how low-budget movies can still be astonishingly well-made.Finally, Aja and LeBlanc bring several themes to the table, identity maybe being the biggest one. What truly makes us human? Feelings and memories? Physical suffering? It's impossible to dive into this subject without spoiling some of the most shocking moments of the story, but it's only one of many underlying storylines that ultimately make Oxygen a beautiful example of profound storytelling. General topics such as health and politics are also approached, as well as moral dilemmas regarding extremely advanced technology and what humans should do with it. Honestly, it's been three days, I watched two other films meanwhile, and I'm still thinking about this one...Oxygen is a phenomenal example of one-location filmmaking done right, which will, unfortunately, escape most viewers' radar. Christie LeBlanc's extremely detailed screenplay packs shocking, impactful revelations and plot twists that will leave no one indifferent. Brutal moral dilemmas, surprising discoveries about the mysterious protagonist, and a fantastic one-woman show from Mélanie Laurent keep the slow, flashback-heavy narrative engrossing. Boasting many underlying themes, Alexandre Aja maintains a suspenseful, tense atmosphere with a sense of urgency that never quite leaves the screen. Maxime Alexandre's creative camera work and Robin Coudert's mood-setting score elevate this deep study about human identity without ever feeling too ambiguous. For fans of claustrophobic thrillers with sci-fi elements, Netflix currently holds one of my favorite movies of the year. Highly recommend it.Rating: A-\n",

            "Review: I've read some reviews and I think that some are missing the point of it. Yes, I think it's true that hollywood is annoyingly using the same tropes over and over again. I think that the makers of this movie wanted to give a specific message and tell their story through this unoriginal concept. Some of the negative reviewers are saying that this film has nothing new to offer, but I disagree. I think that it brings up some good questions about life. I really think that this movie is more than just a run of the mill teen romance. It seems like most teen flicks feel the need to be edgy and trashy. While many enjoy that, it isn't everyone's cup of tea.I enjoyed how colorful it is and I thought that the acting was really good. I think that it manages to be quirky without diving into annoying territory. I think that it blended the drama and humor together well. I liked the soundtrack. That one shot scene was done so well!Perhaps this movie is more deep than it's meant to be. I agree with the comments about how it's another teen movie getting all existential, but I still like the way that it was handled. I love good symbolism in any story. The dog represents all the time that can pass by. We see so much but are missing exactly what we're looking for, even when it's right there in front of us. The angel wings. I believe that they represent how there's always good in this world of evil. The eagle catching the fish from the lake. Well, the female character explains that one. Spoiler- rain in stories usually symbolizes the new in life. Washing away the old. It could mean that there's something better. I suppose that there could be even more that I missed.Unfortunately, once again they cast actors that are too old to be playing teens. I also was not a fan of the sob story plot twist near the end.I was also SO disappointed that they ended up kissing at the end. I love stories that are simply just about friendship and I got my hopes up with this one. I almost believed that they wouldn't end up together at the end. It seemed refreshing.I can understand why this movie did not work for some, but I liked it. I watched it on valentine's day. It's also a good movie for february because of groundhog day!\n",

            "Seeing history brought to life in a viscerally real and emphatic manner, made the work very compelling to me.Fred Hampton was killed at the age of 21 on December 4th, 1969. The aggrieved parties would wait well over a decade for justice with a civil suit settlement of $1.85 million in 1982 after an initial coroner's jury inquest in January of 1970 found Fred Hampton's death justifiable homicide.The writing pulls heavily from historical texts with Black Panther phrases such as \"War is politics with blood. Politics is war without blood.\" King also manages to pose questions about how to make progress as his characters address the concepts of reform and revolution. While the film is set in 1968-69, these issues are still prevalent today. On HBO Max. Do yourself a favor and check it out. You'll be glad you did.\n",

            "Review: 'The Dig' is a delicate tale with multiple layers. As is the case with good drama, the characters are multiple and varied in in their subtleties and their complexities. Interestingly, one of the lead characters is not a sentient being, but a meadow in a Suffolk field in England. However, this field is no ordinary fallow area of grass, it is populated by large mounds - likely ancient burial sites. Thus, this movie is innately interwoven with an archeological story of excavation and the potential of wondrous historical discovery.Parallel to this quite prosaic undertaking are several very human and engaging stories of grief, tragedy, recognition, ambition, greed and human revelation. These tales are very human, delicately explored on the screen through a well written script, exposed with a sensitivity not unlike the granular and studied removal of spoil from an archeological dig.There are numerous captivating dramatic portrays, not just involving the central protagonists, but also in the revelations of the supporting cast as well. A beautifully crafted piece of British drama where almost all cast members are given space of annunciate their role and emphasise their voice and their dynamic characteristics on screen. Humble characters are given the dramatic landscape and opportunity to shine. Thus, quiet characters are highlighted in a vibrant silabancy, adding to the dramatic ambiance of the production. A most enjoyable experience for this viewer, at least for me, anyway. Highly recommended.\n",

            "Review: Do not get deceived by first appearances. Yes, it's a small movie, it stars Frank Grillo, who had to act in some pretty shoddy films in order to get ahead and it's not something for the Oscars, but it is a perfect little film for what it wants to do. The plot is simple: infinite time loop, second movie like that I've seen in two days. But instead of having the hero moan about the boredom of having infinite time, which always annoys the hell out of me, it starts with people wanting to kill him. All top assassins, finding him wherever he runs. And if he dies, he starts over, if he does not, his wife dies, then his son, then the world ends.If I had to compare it with an existing film, I would rather compare it to Hardcore Henry than to other time loop films. Yet that film was an experiment in video game cinematics, while this is a decent sci-fi story: a good ole what-if, with some action sprinkled for fun. So congratulations to Joe Carnahan and to Frank Grillo, because they made one of those gems in the mud that people talk about. And yes, Mel Gibson is a secondary character at best, but so is Michelle Yeoh, and both are perfect for their roles and they clearly have fun with them.Bottom line: watch it, you won't be disappointed.P.S. Is Naomi Watts annoying in real life, too? I mean, all her characters are awful. In this one she admits she didn't know whether her plan would work, you know, the one where she kills her husband over and over and over again, then the world ends.\n",

            "Review: Huey P. Newton, Bobby Seale, Eldridge Cleaver are familiar names in Black Panther historical lore. Fred Hampton's story, however, is not well-known by the general public. This movie rights that travesty. The movie is simply fantastic, well-acted, produced and engrossing from the first frame. Daniel Kaluuya wears this role like a second skin. Whoever says a Brit cannot play an American revolutionary convincingly, can go pound sand. LaKeith Stanfield plays Bill O' Neal, a Judas, with such conviction, it was difficult not to hate his character the entire movie. However, he does manage to muster some sympathy as you see he begins to believe in the Black Panther's cause and is torn between the cause and his deception. Dominque Fishback does a nice job playing Hampton's love interest. Jesse Plemons, as the crooked FBI agent, was appropriately sleazy. Overall, one of best movies so far this year. I hope it picks up some nominations.\n",

            "Review: So this film is about feminism. If you remove that from the story, almost nothing is left. But that doesn't make it a bad movie. I liked the girls, they were so beautiful and vibrant, and the idea that some people are being ignored and stepped on systematically should feel disgusting to all, so it was a story worth telling. The acting was very good for young people and the direction was good, too.Yet it's not a perfect film. There was a moment when a girl admits to tripping one guy who broke his hand and not apologizing about it because that's feminism. No, it's not! And while the girls were from all kinds of races and had their own well shaped characters, the guys were just black and white: the nice sensitive down with feminism guys and the total complete asshole athletic rapists or complete morons. Other than about 4 guys, the others just don't have any lines, it's solely about the girls and their viewpoint. The message here is \"shout out! express yourself however you want! nothing can stop you!\" when reality is that, yes, it can stop you quite hard. So for that reason alone, I call it a feel good movie, because it was like an extreme caricature of life.Bottom line: yes, it's an Amy Poehler vehicle to push her agenda, but it is also a feel good movie about girls finding their voices. I also felt that Lala stole the film, because she came off as much more centered and powerful (not to mention beautiful) than the lead actress. Also, the poster for the film almost made me skip it.

It tells the story of Fred Hampton, Chairman of the Illinois Black Panther Party, and his fateful betrayal by FBI informant William O'Neal. At its release during the Sundance Film Festival this year, I was lucky enough to see this. After seeing almost 30 movies, I felt the fatigue at that point and didn't feel as strongly about the film. I did give it a higher score than I felt initially because I knew that I would like it more had not felt the way I did. Let me tell you, watching this a second time was phenomenal. Shaka King made an incredible piece of work. It exceeds as a thriller. The whole time I felt like I was on the edge of my seat. The scenes are so intense and it's King's great direction. I love how the technical aspects are presented. Firstly, the score is both unnerving and fitting for the time period. The cinematography looks stunning and is shot in a way to make you feel like you're apart of the story. And the editing only helps with the thrill of it. King also wrote the screenplay along with Will Berson. The dialogue is really good. Sometimes with biopics, writers are more focused on the factual aspect that they forget to use dialogue to further develop these characters in a meaningful way. All the characters, or rather real people, had a connection with the audience. And I really like how they don't necessarily take one side to the story. Yes, we're supposed to side more with the Black Panthers, and we do the whole time, but it also shows how it could get extreme sometimes with Fred Hampton's views.Speaking of Fred Hampton, Daniel Kaluuya is phenomenal. There's no possibly way he won't win the Oscar. This is one of the performances that sticks with you long after watching. He captured Hampton's essence perfectly. Another great performance comes from Dominique Fishback as Deborah Johnson. Her performance is going to make her a well-known actress in the future. LaKeith Stanfield also gives a wonderful performance as always. You can see the conflict in his eyes the whole time. This is just one of the best ensembles recently. There really isn't much to hate here. I had a pacing issue at one point, but the film is stellar. I can't imagine anyone really hating this, unless they have a vendetta against the Black Panthers or something. Even CinemaScore gave it an A. As the Oscars approach soon, I'd hope that this gets the attention it deserves. Though it hasn't been showing up at many awards (other than Kaluuya), it's accessible to all with its release in theaters and HBOMax. Also the reviews have all been positive except just a few. I think Judas and the Black Messiah is one of the best thrillers out there and will be remembered as one of the best of the 2020s.\n",

            "Review: It is one of those films that are soothing for me to watch. Knowing characters like Edith existed (and continue to exist) turns on a light. She tells excavator Basil Brown that she \"feels\" something lays beneath the mounds on her property. Of course she is an experienced archeologist and of course, as Daniel Kahneman says, she has the \"expert intuition\" but she says she feels, nonetheless. She pursued this undertaking not only because as an archeologist she could recognize the patterns but also because she was compelled by her inner forces to try and create something very much worth experiencing and not just for herself. As the story progresses she finds out she is terminally ill. She draws strength from each to face the other and manages to make such harmonious realizations of both endeavors. It reminded me of a scene in which Harry (in Harry Potter stories), abandoning all apparent logic, goes to see Hagrid in his shed. I don't recall in what context this happens but I do remember as a result of this act, everyone (that mattered) came to a better understanding of the situation. It doesn't seem like a significant scene but it had stayed with me, I think, because it shows how beautiful it can be if we sometimes embody something more than mere common wisdom.In a scene Mr. Brown's wife, trying to reassure him of his work, reminds him of some of his own words. She remarks archeology is not about the past nor it is about the present but that it is about the future, so that future generations know what came before them, know their forefathers. Because of their findings it became clear that Anglo Saxons were cultured people that had rich rituals, art and trade.After extracting the treasure and after all the excitements are over, Mr. Brown returns to the cite to carefully bury back the ship or more precisely the impressions of the ship, giving it the respect it deserved. Not only by his conviction, he shed some light to the lives of the people who had lived more than thirteen centers before in the land but also he had the capacity to pay respect to the people who were gone eons before.And all of this happened while some people were thinking the best thing could be done was waging a war against humanity and, well, the rest were making preparations for defense.One thing I'd like to point out is I think a typical child does not respond to the pain of that magnitude like how Edith's son is portrayed. A child's response would be more like Conor in A Monster Calls. Now that I've mentioned this I have to confess I adore both Carey Mulligan and Felicity Jones. So, you better take my review with this knowledge ;)\n",

            "Review: I was really excited to watch this film. I love sci-fi and I'm a big fan of both actors. I was looking for something fun and quirky but that's not what it is. About 15-20 minutes into the film I had to adjust my expectations. I had to shift my thinking from sci-fi to drama because that's what it really is. *SPOILER*It's a drama about addiction. A lot of people probably didn't realize this because they've never had to deal with a loved one that has addiction issues. Unfortunately I have and I saw all the signs. I understand why the writer/director wanted to leave it up to interpretation but I think that just led to some confusion - especially for people who don't have any experience with an addiction. I also think there's a bit of mental illness in there as well and that fits because a lot of people with mental illness self medicate with illegal drugs.All of the haziness occurs when people are coming down off their high. During their highs everything is blissful - or so it seems. That's the only thing that could explain why people would hurt their families - especially their children - so much.I think it's a worthwhile movie with great acting. I think people will enjoy this more once they adjust their expectations.\n",

Also, the aspect of war from the comfort of home with this generation and its love for video games and how that translates to the removal from the real life consequences of pressing a button thousands of miles away first pulling a trigger with boots on the ground in combat is yet another real-time issue.I would have given it a ten but the ending did fall short of the build up.

The story here was very interesting, because we have an African American working with the FBI against his own people. I was not aware of this story, and I was glad to learn about the character of Fred Hampton through this movie.Daniel Kaluuya was so good. Through his passionate acting, he captured the character of Hampton as an electrifying and inspirational orator who genuinely wanted freedom for all people. I enjoyed his presence in every scene he was in. LaKeith Stanfield as the Judas was also good. I bought that he was very reluctant in participating in the operation, and also how scared he was of getting caught.The movie showed the harsh condition and oppression that the FBI had against the revolutionary. The violence and brutality were shocking and unbelievable.My only problem was that I wish I could learn more about the work of Fred Hampton. The movie was very quick in showing how popular and influential he was, but I wanted more from that.Overall, a brutal yet educational film about one of the great revolutionaries that more people should know about. 8.5/10\n",

            "Review: I going to come clean and say I flat out loved this film. It has a great cast, script, action, direction and of course special effects. Equally important, the choreography in the fight scenes is excellent. I never thought I was being hoodwinked or short changed by careful cutting, rapid shot changes or careful camera placement.Although it has a pretty good if somewhat simplistic storyline, it has been adapted very imaginatively with what is actually quite a lot of forethought planning and development. I felt a little cheated with the ending but on retrospect, I couldn't really have asked for too much more... maybe they're doing a Boss Level II.Normally I expect Frank Grillo to be either a second tier good guy, when the likes of some A-lister is unavailable or possibly out of budget, or a first rate bad guy, a role he tends to somewhat excel in. Here he's the star attraction and with Naomi Watts and Mell Gibson bringing up the rear and it's a good combination.Grillo is sharp, witty, romantic and... well, displays a range as an actor that we rarely see him portray, and he does a great job. As an action actor there are few who can walk in his shoes, both physically and with his on screen presence, let's face it, he gets a lot of work in this area for a good reason, but I wasn't expecting him to be a lead in a role that really demands a lot more of his acting ability, and quite frankly, I'm pleasantly surprised. Not that I'm saying he couldn't act before, just that, well... I've not seen him in many parts where he's had much more to do than be/look hard, and or beat people up.Gibson is Gibson at this stage of his career, gritty, unhinged and accomplished.Watts is never truly convincing as a scientist/doctor/researcher. The rather alluring slinky dress that functions as a lab coat or some other type of boffin garb was ill thought out, but she nevertheless manages to deliver a competent performance whilst adding a sultry appeal that doesn't go unmissed... perhaps the dress isn't such a bad idea after all.The minor cast is for the most part an accomplished line up of add-ins who do a pretty good job in filling in the necessary spaces for villain-hood, goonish ineptitude and thuggery. Some are quite enthralling and I loved the way that a multitude of baddies are employed for skulduggery, even if it is (given the protagonist and his lack of superpowers) somewhat excessive. Whilst Michelle yeo is largely unused, she nevertheless gives the story some credibility.Anyway, I won't give away any details on the plot but it is a good film with a pretty solid delivery all round. I'm not going to nit-pick on the fine points of the story or temporal mechanics of the notions therein, and even though I do like the fact they didn't try and explain away some aspect of science, I didn't so much like that a fair amount of meat was left off the bones of the science aspect of the film... not that it mattered much since it wasn't really the focal point of the film... well, not really.Anyway, go see it. Solid 7.5 out of 10 for me but I'll give it an 8 since it was an unexpected pleasure to watch.\n",

            "Review: Wrong Turn 2: Dead End (the 'R' in Turn is actually written backwards on the opening credits not that it matters much...) is set in Greenbrier Back County in West Virginia where a new reality show called 'Active Survivors' is being staged, six contestants are there to survive the tasks & maybe win $100,000. The six contestants are paired up, it's Nina (Erica Leerhsen) & Mara (Aleksa Palladino), Jake (Texas Battle(!)) & Elena (Crystal Lowe) while Amber (Daniella Alonso) is stuck with Jonsey (Steve Braun) all of whose first task is to find food. Tracked throughout the playing area by hidden cameras they discover finding food isn't as easy as it first sounds, their problems increase even further when a bunch of inbred cannibals decide they want to eat all the contestants & production team. Stranded miles from the nearest town & unable to contact anyone the contestants must fight back in a real life game of survival or become cannibal food...This American Canadian co-production was directed by Joe Lynch & one has to say for what it was Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is a throughly enjoyable & pleasingly gory horror thriller, a direct to video/DVD sequel to Wrong Turn (2003) one has to say I didn't have high hopes for it as cheap sequels to horror flicks usually aren't very good & ones that go straight to video/DVD are even more likely to suck. To be fair both Wrong Turn films rip-off other films like The Texas Chainsaw Massacre (1974), Deliverance (1973) & just about any other slasher film you care to mention & by all rights both should be crap but surprisingly neither are. The script by Turi Meyer & Al Septien does exactly what it sets out to do, it's a straight forward backwoods slasher flick with loads of over-the-top gore & violence. Call me easily pleased but I loved the gore in this film, call me slightly sick but I loved the level of violence & the films intention to deliver lots of blood soaked set-pieces is, in my opinion, highly commendable. Some unenlightened viewers may say the film is full of pointless gore, well as far as I'm concerned there's no such thing as pointless gore! The character's are alright, I must admit I liked the army veteran Dale as he turns the tables on the cannibals & turns them from being the hunters to the hunted & I also liked the main heroine Nina as I thought she had a bit about her, she was vulnerable when she needed to be yet strong when it comes down to it. At only 90 odd minutes in length the film moves along like a rocket, your never far from the next blood soaked killing & the climax literally paints the screen red with blood, imagine a slaughterhouse but instead of cattle insert human beings. I even liked the ending which points to a sequel & features green toxic waste & an ugly mutant baby!Director Lynch does a good job, he has chosen to do away with the suspense, tension & atmosphere & goes for all out gore which I for one won't be complaining about. I love gory films, the nastier & bloodier the better & Wrong Turn 2: Dead End doesn't disappoint, people are chopped vertically in half with axes, people have arrows shot into their eyeballs, people minced up in huge machines, there are cannibal scenes, someone gets their throat ripped out & an absolute fountain of blood gushes everywhere, someone has barb wire wrapped around their wrists, , people are graphically blown to pieces with dynamite, axes in heads, someone has their back hacked away, there's plenty of intestines, body parts, decapitated heads, brains, offal, gallons of blood, bodily parts & severed limbs & much more. There's also a gross scene when the cannibals force Nina to eat some meat & there's little bits all round her mouth as she can't wipe it off which looks pretty disgusting. Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is a gore hounds wet dream, I guess I'm going to have to change my bedsheets tomorrow... I'm not sure if this is available in an 'R' rated & 'Unrated' editions but if it is you know which one you should go for & if you don't go & sit in the corner on your own until you do!With a supposed budget of about $4,000,000 this actually had a pretty decent amount of money spent on it, apparently shot in 25 days in Vancouver in British Columbia in Canada this has good production values & is well made. The special effects are good with a mixture between good old fashioned latex, rubber & fake blood along with some decent CGI computer effects. The acting is OK, I particularly liked Leershen the heroine who has a great way of looking surprised & is also very easy on the eyes. By the way, why would anyone call their child Texas Battle?Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is a great horror flick which doesn't even try to be deep or meaningful & the whole reality TV show setting is more of a plot device to get people out into the open rather than a deliberate thing which to satirise or make fun of. For what Wrong Turn 2: Dead End is this is fantastic & it also has some of the best gore scenes I've seen in ages as well which help.\n",

John Wick meets Groundhog Day!The movie starts off with a an assassin trying to kill Frank Grillo's character Roy Pulver and never lets up on the action. When it does ease up you have some quirky comedy met with some touching father & son moments. Very interesting that Franks Grillo's real son played his on screen son Joe, this explains their natural chemistry. Some of my favorite moments are of the swords-woman Guan Yin and every time she kills Frank Grillo says, \"This is Guan Yin and Guan Yin has done this!\" So it's hilarious and satisfying when Frank Grillo's character Roy kills Guan Yin and says, \"This is Roy and Roy has done this!\" Such brilliance.I never really appreciated a Frank Grillo until now. I remember watching a Purge movie with him but nothing super memorable came from it, but this movie really showcases his talents in the most superb way. I think the guy is in his 50's and he's rocking a perfect in shape body and looks healthier than most 20 year olds. I'm left with wanting more of this awesome action star.Oh yeah and the movie also showcases some heavy hitters like Mel Gibson and Naomi Watts who do a great job as well. But the real GEM and STAR of this movie is Frank Grillo. And the movie has a fantastic ending so you will not be disappointed.\n",

The movie takes place over one night and only features two characters. Many would argue that there wasn't a plot, but there are many films that have won awards without even having a plot. The point of this movie is to relate and understand these two characters. Personally i believe that some people are not as invested in the movie and thats why this movie is getting some bad reviews, but that's ok because everyone is different. Just know before watching this movie that you really shouldn't expect any big explosions, sex scenes, or big plot twists. This movie is just a simple little story.\n",

An amateur, yet skilled archaeologist, Basil Brown, is retained by the wealthy owner of the Sutton Hoo estate to allow him to search for ancient artifacts on her sprawling farm. Mrs. Edith Pretty rankles The British Museum's curator, by selecting Mr. Brown university over degreed archeologists supported by him.\n",

This movie captures what it's like to be REALLY in love past the honey moon stage. It's raw; it's not a dipiction of some false reality of love. It doesn't portray toxicity like some of the reviews I've seen claims. It portrays two people who understand DEPTH, whilst one (Marie) actually understand their own trauma. Toxic would look like two people projecting their mental issues, past traumaS, and emotional baggage all day long. However, this is RAW In that the sense that two people are trying to rack through the mist and muck of their emotions, with logic nonetheless. If you're one who understands their own psychology, whilst understands their partner's, while all the while remaining grounded, you'll understand this movie fully. But if all you know of is booty calls, \"situationships\" , and trauma bonding, the message goes right over your head. Poor souls.\n",

            "Review: First off, I've been a fan of the Saw franchise since 2009. Ever since I've probably seen each one of them at least a few times. So when I heard about this film in February 2020 I got super pumped for Spiral. That was until it's inevitable delay to May 2021. I still did not give up hope. I knew they would come up with an amazing story that would satisfy Saw fans and possibly invite new fans to the franchise.That's brings up to May 13th, 2021. One year later. Was it worth the wait? The short answer: HELL YES!!It is one of the best Saw movies in the franchise. Top 3 easily in my opinion. Darren Lynn Bousman did an amazing job directing this one after Saw II, III, and IV. The atmosphere in this film was great with the shades of yellows and blues in the frame were a nice change in pace from what we're used to. The story was fantastic. Chris Rock holds his own in a horror/thriller movie so hopefully that kills any doubt you had that a comedic actor such as himself couldn't make this work.Don't get me wrong, while this movie looks and feels like a Saw movie, it stands apart in many ways. This is very much inspired by Se7en especially when dealing with the aftermath of the victims. The buddy cop element is present as well giving a new way for the franchise to add some depth to its characters. Chris Rock and Max Minghella play well together as Zeke and William respectively, bouncing banter off each other making for some funny comedic moments.The traps were simple and brutal just the way the original Saw was although much more bloody and graphic. Not over the top like some of the last few Saw movies. The concepts behind them were very inventive and added more purpose to the story even. So if you're a gore fan there's plenty for you to marvel at.There's plenty more I can say about how great this movie was. It is Saw like you remember with an extra Se7en-inspired heart. I cannot recommend this movie more. Congratulations to Chris Rock, Max Minghella, Samuel Jackson, Marisa Nichols, and Darren Lynn Bousman. Can't wait to see it again soon!\n",

This movie does a great job in conveying the claustrophobic experience Melanie's character has to go through, with the countdown to death keeping the suspense. Plot keeps you guessing with each twist, and makes the audience imagine what they would go through in each step. Granted, some decisions can seem far-fetched, irratic, but given the conditions and the origins of the main character, it should be enough to forgive its flaws.This movie gave me \"Moon (2009)\" vibes, eliciting a virtual simulation of an emotional ride I would have, if I was in the protagonist shoes (pod).\n",

            "Review: My daughter and I watched this movie tonight and absolutely loved it. Being from Hawaii and now living in the mainland it was fun to watch this movie... yes it's very much like goonies but the infusion of the Hawaii culture, language and folk lore made it all the more special. The night marchers story was very similar to what we were taught growing up as was the pidgin and infusion of Hawaiian words. Loved that their home was authentic with glass jalousie windows and tons of wood paneling. The filming of most of the film appears to be in Hawaii and they even have Halona beach from \" from here to eternity\" in it. The cast looks like the majority of them are from Hawaii which is refreshing considering the majority of the tv shows filmed in Hawaii have lead characters who are not from Hawaii and butcher the Hawaiian Pidgin and culture. The family relationship is realistic and my kids could identify with the siblings. It was.clean and light hearted. I would recommend to anyone, but if your not from Hawaii put the closed captioning on for the Hawaiian words. 💛💛\n",

            "Review: This film delivers well on what it sets out to do, it's depiction of a real tested relationship with less-realistic dialogue makes it feel like a physical fight between two heavyweights who keep delivering hit after devastating hit to eachother.It's been critiqued for 'over-doing it' in lots of aspects but everything about this film is made to be interesting to watch, whether it be a noticeably long lateral tracking shot at the beginning or the bold black-and-white or the incredible dialogue. Yes, real people don't talk as smoothly but isn't that the point? What if you could be a fly on the wall during a poetic argument between two beautiful people in their beautiful home? It's not 'realistic' because it's much more sleek than 'real'.I just got fed up of people hating on this film because it's pretty great.I\n",

The chemistry betweeen the lead cast is phenomental, and the plot flows well. Obviously, you can guarentee how any film like this ends, but they still do a great job even there. The little sub plots within don't take anything away from this Motion Picture.Overall, Amazon/Netflix usually thrive with TV and leave something behind when making a film. However, Amazon have truly delivered a classic here.\n",

            "Review: After watching the first Wrong Turn ages ago and seeing that two sequels were out, I had no high hopes and thought that the sequel would crash and burn but I was way, way ahead of myself. As described up at the top (my summary) this film appears as a very fun, gory and very messed up sequel which works. I'm going to get to the excellent points about what makes this sequel fun to watch.The director actually gives us a decent story which we can watch and work out. He also gives us enough creepy scenes for where we can be creeped out sometimes.The director gave us some good kills and I actually enjoyed all of these kills and none of them were crappy at all. The actions sequences and chases sequences were also executed well and that made the film bump up to it's right potential.The one little problem I had though was the cannibals who didn't look as effective or as real as the ones in the first film. They were cool and it was excellent how they started up a family and they brought Three Finger back, but they just weren't real enough to say that it was at least scary.Another thing was the director said that he added humor but I found none.But overall the story is stable enough and good enough, the music score is decent, the characters are likable and the sequences of each scene was done (not as good as the original) but still good enough my liking.This sequel deserves to be watched straight after the first (something I didn't do, lol). 7.7/10\n",

            "Review: The world needs more subtlety like this.The story doesn't need to be groundbreaking, riveting or shocking, but can be about normal things that are expressed in a genuine way, with top-notch acting across the board that helps The Dig tremendously.The thing that appealed to me the most were the sub plots of love, endearment and commitment within the main plot of the film: the uncovering of some remarkable remains and treasures, which hold the movie together and are the lynch pins, but not the most important aspect of the story because it's the underpinning relationships between lovers, mothers, sons and grandparents that bring The Dig full circle in an especially pleasing way.The movie isn't an epic one and there are very few triple-A scenes or effects that may have you drooling, such as the incredible war scenes in Atonement, but it does have enchantment in buckets and spades and hopefully, like me, you'll be taken in and pacified by its extra slice of caring and love that's much needed in all of our lives, whoever we may be.Watch it; it's very very nice and the acting is an absolute delight.\n",

            "Review: As someone who did not know the real events or people this movie was based on, it was an eye-opening experience into what life was like back then. The camera work is rock solid, with genuine tense moments and powerful performances from the main characters.Watching the events unfold back then brings an interesting juxtaposition to recent events in America. Police brutality rooted in racism is still a reality. People in power with discriminatory beliefs still exists. It made me think about several realities that are still going on today. It made me think about how people in power can easily abuse their position. We like to think regulation is important to keep these people in check, but who's regulating the regulators? People in power can easily hire regulators to maintain the status quo.And what about crime rates? It disproportionately involves people of color because of centuries of racism that become rooted in the very culture of children born in lower socioeconomic groups. Violence begets violence, and crime begets more crime. We're definitely living in a better time now than what it was like 50 years ago. But we can do better. And nothing is more powerful than educating the next generation about the truth, about critical thinking, and about actively doing what they believe is right.I have barely talked about this film, but I appreciate that a film like this exists. It allows the viewer into a glimpse of the past, informing the audience about an issue that perhaps they may not understand. It puts us directly into the shoes of a group of people doing what they think is right for their future generation. It is creative works like these that may challenge your world view, and it may help you understand about the struggles and plight of people that are different than you. To that, I applaud the film.For those who have no idea about the real events like I was, this is a great film to increase your awareness on a subject you might not know much about.\n",

            "Review: OK, \"Willy's Wonderland\" isn't a great film. Not sure it's even a good one. But it is totally bonkers from beginning to end and is wildly entertaining. Nicolas Cage plays a man, just called \"The Janitor\" because he agrees to spend a night cleaning up \"Willy's Wonderland\", a run down version of \"Chuckie Cheese.\" While he's in there, he gets attacked by one of the animatronic animals come to life. He summarily destroys it, puts on a clean \"Willy's Wonderland Staff\" t-shirt and gets back to cleaning. But it turns out that \"Willy's Wonderland\" has a dark and horrific past, it's no accident that he is in there, and that won't be the last monster he faces this night...This movie is insanely entertaining the entire length of its running time. It has a satanic backstory, annoying teenagers getting killed in messy and gory fashion, and Nicolas Cage going full-on \"Nicolas Cage\", leading to one of the characters saying what should become a classic line -- \"He's not locked in with them, they're locked in with him.\"Totally recommended. Put your brain on hold for 90 minutes and have a great time.\n",

            "Review: On the brink of Britain's entry into World War II, self trained archaeologist Basil Brown (Ralph Fiennes) is sought out by land owner Edith Pretty (Carey Mulligan) to excavate and investigate what look like ancient burial mounds on her property. Starting out as virtually a one man operation, Brown's early findings pique the interest of the local Ipswich Museum, and eventually gains the attention of Charles Phillips (Ken Stott) of the British National Museum. It's not until the end of the picture that we learn the name of the Sixth Century Anglo-Saxon discovery which came to be known as the Sutton Hoo Treasure, a burial ship with related antiquities dating back much further than originally expected. A number of human interest stories are inserted into the picture to humanize the participants, as Ms. Pretty faces her own mortality with a debilitating illness, while Mr. Brown takes a favorable liking to her young son, an enthusiast of astronomy for which Brown is a willing mentor. As the film progresses, the commoner Brown maintains a stoic resolve against the elitist pretensions of Charles Phillips, and is favored by Ms. Pretty to receive the proper credit for his discovery. The film makers opt to sentimentalize the end of the picture with Britain's entry into World War II, as Ms. Pretty bequeaths the fantastic find as a gift to the British Museum, where it would be seen by the most number of people. Held in safekeeping during the War in an underground location, the Sutton Hoo was finally exhibited nine years after Edith Pretty's death in 1942.\n",

While the movie does have a few rather predictable scenes, they're mingled with unexpected twists, immensely effective jump scares, and excellent character development. While a few minor characters' acting may be a bit sub-par (which is never the fault of the top billed cast, of course), the raw intensity of Jeffrey Dean Morgan's character more than makes up for it. The CGI doesn't look the best at first, since the initial scene that uses it is in a dream sequence, but after that, it is so realistic that you can scarcely tell that it wasn't done with live actors (it does, however, have an effect around it which serves to make it even more unnatural, which some may find to look bad). A fantastic cast, wonderful direction, great writing, and a terrifying antagonist all work in tandem to make this movie the best horror film I've seen since The Empty Man. It's entertaining, easy to follow, and, to be perfectly honest, I don't remember the last time that an entire (socially distanced) theater full of people all jumped and screamed at the exact same time at an unexpected jumpscare. Do yourself a favor and watch this movie. You'll love it.\n",

I once saw Talledega Nights with a girl I was very much in love with-it was a time when NO good movies were being released and Snakes on a Plane was out at the same time so those were our choices. Let me tell you that Talledega Nights was the worse movie I ever paid for and had to suffer through. Terrible film. But the reason why I bring it up is that a piece of junk movie like that was still well received by a few airheads and they thought it was funny- the girl i liked being one of the few airheads who liked it. That movie scores higher on IMDb than this movie does and that is a down right shame because I would give TN a 1 out of 10 or 4 out of 10 if I were being more fair, but I would give THIS move Cherry 2000 a 7 out of 10 at least. What does this all prove? That movie ratings can sometimes be misleading. That someone can tell you a movie is awful and you would find that same movie great, and vice versa. So what this ultimately means then is that you have to watch this movie yourself and come to your own conclusion. As for myself I was pleasantly surprised. I had low expectations and found this entertaining enough and it moved right along smoothly. The movie has a good pace.\n",
